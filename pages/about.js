                »Gradedproject is an online library that harbors final year
                project research topics and materials for enhancing academic
                excellence in conducting research. It provides quality research
                materials on almost all fields of study so as to meet the
                research needs of final year students in tertiary institutions.
                These final year project research topics and materials are
                readily available for download on request to interest
                researchers. Beneficiaries of these services have multiplied
                overtime even as this platform is keen to meet further need of
                final year students including their experiences. There are
                thousands of project topics on this platform which serve as a
                good repository for final year project research topics,
                materials and project files. This will enhance and meet the
                research need of final year students. This does not however
                intent to jeopardize any guideline for presentation of academic
                papers by students or encourage plagiarism. Deciding on the
                right final year project topics is one of the challenging issues
                faced by most students in their final year. At times, they do
                not have any idea about the topics, while at instances they are
                caught up between two project topic ideas. In some cases
                however, final year students find it difficult to source
                materials that can aid their project research. Meanwhile,
                students can get the best help from gradedproject. Not only will
                they find a list of project research topics to choose from, they
                will also find details and complete project research materials
                that will serve ONLY as guidelines, frameworks and references to
                their project research. gradedproject contains final year
                project research topics and materials of various fields such
                as:- Mass Communication Project Research Topics and Materials
                Accounting Project Research Topics and Materials Computer
                Science Project Research Topics and Materials Business
                Administration Project Research Topics and Materials and lots
                more.... The arrangement on gradedproject hosts these project
                topics and materials with each department well defined and
                structured to fit into the guideline for presentation of
                research materials. While some of the projects are mere theories
                and do not require any execution, others may require software or
                hardware for their implementation. HOW IT WORKS Finding research
                topics and materials published on gradedproject is quite easy.
                There are over 12,000 published project research topics as at
                January 2019. It is important to note that access to full
                research material is ONLY available on request. Meanwhile, all
                published items give public access to the Projet Topic,
                Abstract, Table of Content and Chapter 1. There are two basic
                ways of finding your research topic(s) on gradedproject. Find
                Project Topic from Department Find Project Topic from Search To
                find your desired project topic using your department, follow
                the simple steps below. Enter the website name
                https://gradedproject.com on your web browser, which will take

                departments. Then Click on the departmental link of your choice,
                this will display published project research topics published
                under that department. Go through the published project research
                topics and get the relevant topic(s) in the area your conducting
                your research. Click on the title of the project research topic,
                this will open a page where you will have access to the project
                abstract, table of content, and chapter one (1). Take time to

                ALSO HOSTS WORKING SOFTWARE SOURCE CODES » Implementations of
                project research topics especially for Final Year Computer
                Science students is vital, therefore part of the gradedproject
                repository also hosts Computer Science Source Codes which are
                implementations of divers solutions to a stated problem in
                either a research work or a challenge seen in the community.
                Except for graduating students who have good knowledge of
                programming, web design and database design, it is not possible
                to get the implementations to their Computer Science Project
                Research Topics without a guide. Our repository hosts software
                source codes that serve ONLY as an implementation guide or
                building block for final year students in computer science
                department and software engineering departments. The published
                source code projects have titles, installation guides (YouTube
                videos and PDF documents), installation requirements including
                the version of supporting software needed to run the source
                code. We also publish attributes of the source code such as
                screen-shots and third party software that the source code is
                compatible with. To get access to the full source code you will
                need to request for it by either clicking the source code
                category such as PHP, C++, C#, Python, Java, Matlab and several
                others on gradedproject. Click the title of any source code
                project you are interested in and then use the “Get Full Access”
                or “Get Complete Source Code” button to request for the full
                source code project. If you face any challenge, feel free to
                contact helpdesk via phone call, WhatsApp or email.
