The study made use of primary data which are gotten from the distribution of the research questionnaires; the sample size for the study is 101. The study made use of the Pearson correlation method and paired sample t-test for the analysis. However there is a statistically significantly <strong>(0.00)</strong> strong relationship <strong>(0.819)</strong> between the responses of the respondents that said that Rhesus factor and sickle cell have significant effect on child mortality rate in Yenegoa and Port Harcourt and those that said that broadcast media reaches higher number of audience in creating awareness for sickle cell and Rhesus.The study therefore concluded that there is significant the difference in effectiveness of media campaign on sickle cell and Rhesus factor. The study also made useful recommendation to assist the federal government in decision making.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0 INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1 BACKGROUND OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The prevalence of sickle cell anemia and Rhesus factor comparability have increased overtime time in Nigeria; thus causing an increase in mortality rate among children especially those below twenty (20) years of age (Kulkarni, 2007). It is widely believe that the causes of sickle cell anemia and Rhesus factor incompatibility is due to a high level of ignorance on the dangers posed by these disease. The federal government of Nigeria through the NGOs and the media has put in so much effort on awareness campaign on how to control the occurrence of these diseases especially for the young ones that are about the ages of getting married. </p> <p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) can simply be defined as a hereditary disorder in which an individual has inherited two abnormal Hb genes, at least one of which is responsible for the production of sickle Hb (HbS) (Creary et al., 2007). The most common clinical phenotype is the homozygote, i.e. HbSS, also known as sickle cell anaemia. Compound heterozygotes include HbSC, SD, SO-Arab and Sbthal, which are all collectively (in addition to SS) referred to as SCD. </p> <p>The sickle-shaped red blood cells described by Herrick caused several complications, including chronic anemia, vaso-occlusive pain episodes, ischemic organ damage, infections, small stature, and delayed puberty (Barakat et al., 2008). For many generations sickle cell disease has been a prevalent disorder in Nigeria. Reports show that sickle cell disease was a well-known disorder in most states in Nigeria and that the natives in Nigeria had several local names for this disease before it was discovered in America (Reid &amp; Rodgers, 2007).</p> <p>According to Modell B, (2007) stated that the HbS gene became prevalent in different parts of the world following selective pressure because the heterozygote (HbAS) is protected against some of the deleterious effects of malaria. Therefore, SCD is found at its highest frequencies in parts of the world where malaria is or was endemic. In the same vein, Fleming AF, (2008) stated that because of slave trade and recent migrations, it is now found even more widely including in Europe and the USA. Nonetheless, the prevalence is highest in tropical Africa and, indeed, the country with the highest burden is Nigeria where the trait occurs in 25–30% and sickle cell anaemia occurs in approximately 2% of all births </p> <p>The most common features of SCD are chronic haemolytic anaemia and recurrent vaso-occlusion. The latter is responsible for the painful crises that characterise the disease. There is also a chronic vasculopathy triggered by free heme resulting in nitric oxide scavenging and upregulation of adhesion molecules in reticulocytes, neutrophils and endothelial cells (Wood KC, 2008). This is further complicated by a procoagulant state following the activation of platelets. There is smooth muscle dystonia and eventual hyperplasia, which contributes to vascular occlusions (Morris CR, 2009). This explains the plethora of features and complications seen in SCD. The major cause of mortality in childhood is overwhelming bacterial infections especially due to encapsulated organisms, principally pneumococcus. </p> <p>On the other hand Rh is short for Rhesus blood group system. The Rh blood type contains parts called antigens including the D antigen. If the D antigen is present, a person is considered to be Rh positive. If the D antigen is absent, the person is said to be Rh negative. About 85% of Nigerians have an Rh positive blood type, while the remaining 15% are Rh negative. The Rhesus factor is very important to the human body; however there might variation in compatibility which results to Rhesus disease. </p> <p>A study of Rh disease deepens our understanding of historical infant mortality in general and perinatal mortality in particular. The decline of infant mortality in Nigeria started around 1800, which is earlier than in most other countries. At that time, rates were very high even if the Nigerians as well as other African countries levels were low in international comparison (Edvinsson et al. 2008). However there have been several awareness campaigns on the sickle cell disease and Rhesus factor comparability among couples in Nigeria. The use of mass media and other medium may help in the dissemination of information on sickle cell and Rhesus factor among couples in Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2 STATEMENT OF PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Sickle cell disease and Rhesus factor issue has been prevalent in Nigeria for a very long time now. Families and friends have lost lives to these ailments as a result of lack of awareness on the preventive measures to be taken to control the ailments. The federal government of Nigeria has channeled lots of funds to the medical centers in Nigeria to help salvage the situation but the incidence is still on the increase. Take yenegoa and portharcourt for example, there are several factors that can lead to the increase in sickle cell disease and Rhesus factor disease; Viz:</p> <p>1.  high level of illiteracy </p> <p>2.  lack of awareness campaign on the effect of sickle cell disease and Rhesus factor among couples</p> <p>3.  low standard of living  </p> <p>4.  poor medical facilities and</p> <p>5.  lack of counseling before marriage</p> <p> It is to this regard that the researcher desire to carry out a comparative study on sickle cell disease and Rhesus factor awareness campaign using mass media.</p> <p><strong>1.3 AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The main aim of the research work is to carry out a comparative study of sickle cell disease and Rhesus factor comparability among couples in Yenegoa and Port Harcourt. Other specific objectives of study are:</p> <p>1.  to examine whether media campaign has a role to play in the level of awareness on sickle cell and Rhesus factor among couples in Yenegoa and port Harcourt</p> <p>2.  to examine whether counseling before marriage will help control the prevalence of sickle cell and Rhesus factor among couples in Nigeria</p> <p>3.  to determine whether low standard of living will increase the mortality rate among children with sickle cell disease</p> <p>4.  to determine the effect of Rhesus factor and sickle cell on child mortality rate in Yenegoa and port Harcourt</p> <p>5.  to determine the extent to which availability of drugs and medical facilities controls sickle cell disease and Rhesus factor in Yenegoa and Port Harcourt</p> <p><strong>1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The study came up with research questions so as to ascertain the above stated objectives. The research questions for the study are:</p> <p>1.  What is the difference in effectiveness of media campaign on sickle cell and Rhesus factor? </p> <p>2.  Does media campaign play a role in the level of awareness on sickle cell and Rhesus factor among couples in Yenegoa and Port Harcourt?</p> <p>3.  Does counseling before marriage help control the prevalence of sickle cell and Rhesus factor among couples in Nigeria?</p> <p>4.  What is the effect of standard of living on mortality rate among children with sickle cell disease?</p> <p>5.  to determine the effect of Rhesus factor and sickle cell on child mortality rate in Yenegoa and port Harcourt</p> <p>6.  To what extent does availability of drugs and medical facilities controls sickle cell disease and Rhesus factor in Yenegoa and Port Harcourt?</p> <p><strong>1.5 STATEMENT OF RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS</strong></p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 1</strong></p> <p><strong>H0:</strong> there is no significant the difference in effectiveness of media campaign on sickle cell and Rhesus factor</p> <p><strong>H1:</strong> there is significant the difference in effectiveness of media campaign on sickle cell and Rhesus factor</p> <p><strong>Hypothesis 2</strong></p> <p><strong>H0:</strong> Rhesus factor and sickle cell have no significant effect on child mortality rate in Yenegoa and port harcourt</p> <p><strong>H1:</strong> Rhesus factor and sickle cell have significant effect on child mortality rate in Yenegoa and port harcourt</p> <p><strong>1.6 SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study on a comparative study of sickle cell disease and Rhesus factor comparability will be of immense benefit to couples in Yenegoa and Port Harcourt and the media because the study will compare the effectiveness of media campaign on sickle cell and that of Rhesus factor. The study will also serve as a source of literature for other researchers that desire to carry out similar research on the above topic. Finally the study will contribute to the body of existing literature and knowledge in this field of study and provide a basis for further research</p> <p><strong>1.7 SCOPE OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study on a comparative study of sickle cell disease and Rhesus factor comparability will be limited to the media house and the couples in Yenegoa and Port Harcourt. The study will cover for a period of seventeen years (2000-2017).</p> <p><strong>1.8 LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The only problem the researcher had in getting information from the respondents on sickle cell and Rhesus factor was the unwillingness of the respondents to give information about their health status. The might affect the information provided by the respondents but the researchers however was able to get good information as regard the research topic by making the respondents feel safe with whatever information they provided to the researcher.</p> <p><strong>1.9 DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p><strong>Sickle cell:</strong> A group of disorders among couples in Yenegoa and Port Harcourt that cause red blood cells to become misshapen and break down </p> <p><strong>Rhesus factor: </strong>Rhesus factor in accordance to the study isan antigen occurring on the red blood cells of couples in Yenegoa and Port Harcourt (around 85 per cent) and some other primates</p> <p><strong>Antigen:</strong> a toxin or other foreign substance which induces an immune response in the body, especially the production of antibodies</p> <p><strong>Genetic counseling</strong>: Communication process between health care provider and client that emphasizes and provides accurate and up-to-date information about a genetic disorder in a sensitive and supportive, non-directive manner (SCDAA, 2005).</p> <p><strong>Hemoglobin</strong>: Chemical substance (an iron containing protein) of the red blood cell, which carries oxygen to the tissues, and gives the cell its red color (SCDAA, 2005).</p> <p><strong>Hemoglobin A (HbA):</strong> Hemoglobin is composed of two alpha globins and two beta globins, normally produced by children and adults (Jones, 2008, p. 119).</p> <p><strong>Hemoglobin C trait (AC):</strong> Inheritance of one gene for the usual hemoglobin (A) and one gene for hemoglobin (C). A person who has the hemoglobin C Trait (AC) is a carrier of the hemoglobin C gene, and is not affected by the gene (SCDAA, 2005).</p> <p><strong>Hemoglobin C disease</strong>: A person has both HbS and HbC and is often referred to as “HbSC.” Hemoglobin C causes red blood cells to develop. Having just some hemoglobin C and normal hemoglobin, a person will not have any symptoms of anemia. However, if the sickle hemoglobin S is combined with the target cell, some mild to moderate anemia may occur (UMMC, 2010).</p> <p><strong>Hemoglobin E disease</strong>: Similar to sickle cell-C disease except that an element has been replaced in the hemoglobin molecule under certain conditions, such as exhaustion, hypoxia, severe infection, and/or iron deficiency </p> <p><strong>Sickle cell trait:</strong> A person carrying the defective gene, HbS, but also has some normal hemoglobin HbA. Persons with the sickle cell trait are usually without symptoms of the disease, but mild anemia may occur under intense, stressful conditions, exhaustion, hypoxia (low oxygen), and/or severe infection. The sickling of the defective hemoglobin may occur and result in some complications associated with sickle cell disease.</p>\n\nA COMPARATIVE STUDY OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE AND RHESUS FACTOR COMPARABILITY AMONG COUPLES<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE AND RHESUS FACTOR COMPARABILITY AMONG COUPLES", "id": 2}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p>Pteridophytes, including ferns and fern-allies, are the earliest of all the land plants which originated during the Silurian period and went on to become the dominant vegetation of earth’s surface during the Carboniferous period. They became the first ever group of plants on earth’s surface showing the presence of well-developed vascular system, thereby, playing an important link in the evolution from cryptogams (algae and bryophytes) to phanerogams (gymnosperms and angiosperms). Though they have largely been replaced by seed plants in the course of evolution, they continue to form an important part of vegetation today and can be found distributed in a wide range of habitats in the moist tropical and temperate forests in the world. The pteridophytes being moisture and shade loving plants congregate at places where humid and damp conditions prevail. Pteridophytes have been used by different tribal communities and folklore as a source of food, fibre, craft, decoration material and medicine. Being a group of lower plants and their restricted distribution, pteridophytes remain unattended and their useful aspects are largely ignored. This present study mainly focuses on the Economic importance of Pteridophytes. Their use in medicine for treatment of external injuries and wounds, use in ornamention, biofertilizers, food, phyto-remediation.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0     Introduction</strong></p> <p>Man has been using plants as a source of food, medicines and many other necessities of life since ancient times. Even to this day the primitive tribal societies that exist depend on the plant life in their surroundings. Though there were investigations of the edible economic values of the higher plants, especially the pteridophytes and angiosperms have been unfortunately ignored. Pteridophytes existing today represent ancient plant species which appeared about 300 million years ago in the late Devonian period (Fernandez <em>et al</em>., 2011).Pteridophytes including ferns and fern-allies are non-flowering, vascular and sporebearing plants. They form a conspicuous element of the earth’s vegetation and are important from evolutionary point of view as they show the evolution of vascular system and reflect the emergence of seed habit in an the plants. About 250 million years ago, they formed the dominant part of earth’s vegetation. But in present day flora, they have been largely replaced by the seed bearing plants. They grow luxuriantly in moist tropical and temperate forests and their occurrence in different eco-geographically threatened regions from sea level to the highest mountains are of much interest (Dixit, 2000).</p> <p>The ferns and fern allies do not form a monophyletic group (Smith, <em>et al</em>. 2006) and pteridophyta as a taxonomic group is now regarded as made up of two classes, Lycopodiophyta (fern allies) and Pteridophyta (true ferns) ( Smith<em> et al. </em>2006; WCMC, 1992). The Lycopodiophyta is represented by only five relict genera (Isoetes, Lycopodium, Phylloglossum, Selaginella and Stilites) (WCMC,1992).The Pteridophyta are much more diverse than the Lycopodiophyta, showing great range of form and cosmopolitan in distribution ( WCMC, 1992) Lycopodiophyta and Pteridophyta is a small group of about 12000 species (WCMC, 1992; Chapman, 2009), with some species gathered in the wild for food and medicine, and others cultivated as food and ornamental plants. The ferns are thought by most people to be quite useless members of the plant kingdom. The deleterious effects of rapid fern growth are well publicized, but their useful aspects are largely ignored. Ferns are distributed in all climate zones of the planet, but have a greater diversity in the tropics (Smith <em>et al.,</em> 2006; Strasburger<em> et al., </em>2003). Ferns show various economic values towards food, fodder indicators, biofertilizers and insect repellents (Ghosh <em>et al.</em>, 2004). Ferns are used as medicines to cure diseases in various countries. In China alone, 401 kinds of pteridophytic medicines have been used for various ailments (Luo 1998).</p> <p>Sarker <em>et al</em>. (2011) reported the medicinal uses of 30 pteridophytes of Tamil Nadu. They were used to treat various ailments viz., wound healing, body sickness, diarrhoea, skin problems, body pain, knee problem, cough, cold, fever, asthma, kidney problem, tonic, chronic disorders, several aches, hair growth, stomach problems, ulcer, sore throat, leprosy, ophthalmic, typhoid, urinary bladder and rheumatism. Khare and Kumar (2007) studied ethnobotany of five pteridophytes viz., <em>Adiantum philippense, Diplazium esculentum, Helminthostachys zeylanica, Lygodium flexuosum </em>and<em> Ophiglossum reticulatum</em> used by the Tharu tribe of Dudhwa National Park, Lakhimpur-Kheri (U.P). The information collected by Singh <em>et al</em>. (2001) reported that 14 common Pteridophytes were used by the local people of Manipur in various forms. Kirn and Kapathi (2001), observed ethnomedical uses of 19 pteridophytes of Jammu and Kashmir.</p> <p>The previous work indicate that the medicinal plants specially the flowering plants are given the more importance in these contents, non-flowering plants particularly fern and fern allies are ignored by scientists. According to Pieroni (2001), evaluation of plant species used in different cultural contexts is necessary in order to infer cultural components related to food acceptance and phytochemical constituents that influence the popularity of edible plants. Plant resources have gained prominence in sub-Saharan Africa as a natural asset through which communities derive food, enabling particularly poor families to achieve self-sufficiency. Documentation of use patterns of pteridophytes across sub-Saharan Africa is of relevance in understanding the importance of this ancient plant group to livelihood strategies of different ethnic groups. This is particularly important for this ancient evolutionary lineage which could potentially become extinct if harvested non-sustainably.</p>\n\nECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF PTERIDOPHYTES <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF PTERIDOPHYTES ", "id": 3}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p>The significance and effects of mosquito on man can never be overemphasized. No human being or other primates can live without good health, as the “adage” says that health is wealth. The aim of this study is to find out or reveal the effect of mosquito on man. It is also to create awareness to the society on the danger of mosquito, especially Ovia North East local government area of Edo State. </p> <p>Four selected villages were used for this study. In each of the village’s four hundred villages of males and females ranges from 20-40 years, and 40 and above were served with questionnaires, which is the basic tool for the study. The finding revealed that most of the localities were not appropriately informed on the effect of mosquito on man.</p> <p>The effect of these findings was discussed suggestion and preventives or control measures were recommended.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Globally, mosquitoes without questioned the most important of the insects. At present time over 200 million people in over a hundred and subtropical countries of the world live under the threat of mosquito. According to world Health Organization (WHO) it is estimated that mosquito causes or contributes to the deaths of between one and three million people each year, mostly children under five years of age. Generally, in science, the study of insects (Etomology) cannot be competed without the broad heading.</p> <p><strong>MOSQUITOES   </strong></p> <p>          Mosquitos play a very important role in any scientific discipline. It is noticeable, however, that an initiative insight into the nature and life circle of any scientific organism only comes to those who have a sound basic of observation and scientific discipline behind them for one to be successful in study of mosquitoes and its effects on man a special attention has to be paid on the study if its habits and life circle. Since special consideration is given to the environment in which these species of organism dwells, its role and mode of breeding should also be considered as these affect the life span of man.</p> <p>          In view of the above differences and diversity, this work will be limited to the study of mosquitoes and its effects on man. Many of mankind’s idealist enemes are found among the 85,000 species of stagnant and mosquitoes in “older dipteral” south largest of the insects groups. Most members of the order have a single pair of wings, hence the name diptera, meaning two lunged, most of them, just like the mosquitoes also posses tubular mouths which can piece the human skin for nourishing blood. The loss of blood is small, but as the insect is sipping, virus and other pathogens may pass from the insects into the human host. Sickness such as malaria, yellow fever, elephantiasis is transmitted through this ways.</p> <p>          There are about fifty species of the family, culiacdac many them are called Gnats,. They are thin flies with long fragile legs and narrow wings. Only the female how ever pieces the skins of mammals and suck blood the male defer from the female in having long pulps and feather like analenae.  In Ovia North East local government in particular and Nigeria in general, there are currently three species of mosquitoes all of which are potential malaria, elephantiasis and yellow fever transmitters. The spotted gnat (Anopheles maculipennis) is an example of the type of mosquitoes the rest with its abdomen raised at an angle and it head in line with the rest of the body. It has spotted wings and one sub-species (athroparus) which breeds in blackish water in coastal district. The common gnat (anlex pipien) is a very abundant mosquitoes near stagnant water and a type which rest with its abdomen parallel with the surface oni which its is resting and it head lowered at an angle. Aedes albopictus is one of the largest and fiercest mosquitoes. It has spotted wings and white ringed legs and body. The females attack man and other mammals literate in building, something and rests in the same position and has a very similar life history to that of a common gnat.</p> <p>          The mosquitoes as a member of the “orde” diptera has no posterior pair of wings but the posterior pair is represented only a pair of small club shaped structures, the halters. These look useless, but this cannot fly without them. A fly with its halters cut off can still beat its wings at the normal frequency and through the normal angle, but it lose control in the air, it a straight course and aliable to fall on its back. These halteres have an important function in the control of flight.      </p> <p><strong>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS</strong></p> <p>Accurate figures has shown that the mortality (death rate) of human being increases rapidly and again, there is an indication that the breeding rate of certain insects like mosquitoes is increasing geometrically too. T he entomology of insects, mosquitoes to be precise shows that most of the death of human being are caused as a result of the diseases transmitted by these vectors to their hosts. An insight of such diseases transmitted by the vectors are malaria caused by the females anopheles mosquitoes, yellow fever, caused by creoles mosquitoes. The transmission of the diseases I normally through the blood stream which contaminate the pure blood, resulting in acute sickness that are characterized by many symptoms such as sever fever, headache, vomiting, tiredness, dizziness loss of appetite which may finally result to death.    </p> <p><strong>1.3       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of the study is to know the effect of mosquitoes on man. It is believed that in Africa as a whole and in Nigeria in particular, the diseases transmitted by mosquitoes to their host-man contributes immensely to about two third (2/3) of the total death recorded annually. So, it is worthwhile to take proper study of these adverse effects and hence know the panacea to curb the problems by reducing the breeding rate of these vectors (INSECTS). Also, the study is to create awareness of the effects of mosquitoes on man.</p> <p>Therefore, this research will help us to study properly of our environment and know what causes the high breeding rate of these insects (particularly mosquitoes) and their control or preventives measures.     </p> <p><strong>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The study will provide knowledge on the danger and effect of malaria on human being. It is serves as a reaching text to members of the public, who could want to gain more or have a deeper knowledge, on the effects of mosquitoes on man. It also will serve as awareness to the people of Ovia North East local government area and to encourage non government organizations (NGOs) to participate in campaigning to the people on the danger of mosquitoes to man and its preventive measures.</p> <p><strong>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTIONS OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>1.           Can illiteracy about mosquitoes increase the rate of growth of mosquitoes and its effect on individual in a community?</p> <p>2.           Are mosquitoes more than people living in urban areas?

They are one of the greatest problems facing children today. The diseases are silent killers unlike accident that kills instantly. Man has been trying to get rid of these diseases, for years but efforts made have proved partially abortive. Specifically, pre-school children (0-5 years old) are prone to communicable diseases because of their close interaction with one another, their non-discriminatory behaviours and also their low immunity power. A disease that is transmitted through direct contact with an infected individual or indirectly through a vector. Also called contagious disease.</p> <p><strong>Communicable Disease Definition</strong></p> <p>        Communicable disease is often called contagious or infectious disease. Anderson (2000) defined a communicable disease as a disease that can be transmitted from one person to another or from lower animal to higher animal (man). He attributed the cause of these diseases to pathogenic microorganisms. Brain (2007) also noted that communicable disease are infectious diseases that can be passed from person to another or from an animal to a person.</p> <p>        It is generally believed that nature harbours many microorganism which are very difficult to see with mere naked eyes except with the use of highly powerful microscopic lens. Those microorganisms which harm the human body are called pathogens. Udoh, Fawole, Ajala, Okafo &amp; Nwana (2007) confirmed that pathogens that harm the body are popularly known as germs. These invade the tissues of the human host where they produce the condition called disease. These germs/pathogens (that is virus, bacteria, protozoan and metazoan) are mostly found in dirty places where the temperature and atmosphere support their existence.</p> <p>        Olaoye (2008) classified communicable diseases into four namely water borne disease, air borne diseases, insect borne and other diseases that are transmitted by contacts and arthropods. Brain (2007) stated that the best way of classifying communicable diseases is by their spread, and these are; air borne or droplet infections; faecal borne or gastro-intestina infections; transmission from animal, from insects and by contacts. Barbara and Bauirer (2007) identified three ways of transmitting communicable diseases as; transmission by contact, by vector and by air.</p> <p>1.     <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Home environment contribute to communicable diseases among school children. In the Africa culture the value of education is highly perfect, be it formal. If one take the formal education as a case study, the home or environment contribute a lot to the hygienic system of the child both of home and in school. As this could prevent some communicable disease that could have affected the pupils because the sound foundation for future prevention of communicable diseases start from home. lack of care at home, some time cause unhealthy rivalry among pupils as it has a negative effect on the health of the child both of home school and its environment.</p> <p>1.     <strong>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to find out the cause and effects of communicable diseases among children in Benin City. specifically, the study sought to:</p> <p>1.     Determine the causes of communicable disease among children in Benin City.</p> <p>2.     Ascertain the effect of communicable disease among children in Benin City.</p> <p>3.     Determine ways to address the issues of communicable disease among children in Benin City.</p> <p>4.     Determine effect of poverty of parents to the spread of communicable diseases among children.  </p> <p>1.     <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The researcher in trying to substantiate the result of his study deducted the following research questions which are:</p> <p>1.     Does lack of parental care lead to spread of communicable disease among children in Benin City?</p> <p>2.     Does lack of health education lead to spread of communicable disease among children in Benin City?</p> <p>3.     Can overcrowding of pupils in classrooms lead to the incidence of communicable disease among children in Benin City?</p> <p>4.     Does poverty of parents lead to spread of communicable diseases among children?   </p> <p>1.     <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>In carrying out the study, the researcher hoped that it would be of great benefit to the public in general and to the educational system in particular. It would help educate parents on how to handle their environment and the health of their children. This study will help school management in preventing the spread of communicable disease in school and how to help children suffering from such problems. Moreover it is hoped that it would help teachers to know how to handle such children when they experience difficulties.</p> <p>1.     <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY/DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This study is restricted to pupils from Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State Benin City. it is also limited to some six primary schools within the study area. The researcher limited her study to primary schools in Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State.</p> <p>Therefore, only primary six from six primary school located in urban and rural areas of the local government were used for the study. They are as follows:</p> <p>1.     Abiokula Primary School, Abudu</p> <p>2.     Adanko Primary School, Evbiboesi</p> <p>3.     Adenko Primary School, Ugo</p> <p>4.     Okogbo Primary School, Okogbo</p> <p>5.     Awannore Primary School, Evboesi</p> <p>6.     Obozogbe Primary School, Obozogbe</p> <p>1.     <strong>DEFINITION OF TERMS</strong></p> <p>Bacteria: Constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from sphere to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacterial inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of earth’s crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationship with plants and animals. They are also known to have flourished in manned spacecraft.  </p> <p>Communicable: (of a disease) able to be transmitted from one sufferer to another contagious or infectious.</p> <p>Disease: A disorder of structure or function in a human, animal, or plant, especially one that produces specific symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury. A disease is a particular abnormal, pathological condition that affects part or all of an organism. It is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by factors originally from an external source, such as infectious disease, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions, such as autoimmune diseases. In humans, “disease” is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for t hose in contact with the person.</p> <p>Endemic: in epidemiology, an infections is said to be endemic in a population when that infection is maintained in the population without the need for external inputs. For example, chickenpox is endemic (steady state) in the UK, but malaria is not. Every year, there are a few cases of malaria acquired in the UK, but these do not lead to sustained transmission in the population due to the lack of a suitable vector.</p> <p>Hazard: A hazard is a situation that poses a level of threat to life, health, property, or environment. Most hazards are dormant or potential, with only a theoretical risk of harm, however, once a hazard becomes “active”, it can create an emergency situation. A hazardous situation that has come to pass is called an incident. Hazard and possibility interact together to create risk.</p> <p>Sporadic: Appearing or happening at irregular intervals in time, occasional, sporadic renewals of enthusiasms. Appearing in scattered or isolated instances, as a disease, isolated as a single instance of something, being or occurring apart from others occurring singly or widely apart in locality; the sporadic growth of plants.</p>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AMONG CHILDREN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AMONG CHILDREN", "id": 5}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p> <p><em>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of malaria among children in Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State.

Malaria has also been one of the world’s worst killer diseases throughout recorded human history. Despite attempt to eradicate it, it remains one of the worst disease in terms of death annually.</p> <p>Malaria parasite was discovered in 1886 by Laveran a military physician working in Constantine Algeria (Ksogstad, 1996). Malaria is a serious notificable infectious illness characterized by periodic chills, fever, sweating and sptemomeguly. It has serious and often fatal complications which gave way to Falciparom malaria. It is intermittent and remittent fever caused by a protozoa parasite that incades the red blood cells. Malaria is a preventable and treatable disease of public health. Malaria is by far the most important insect transmitting disease (Curtis, 1991).    </p> <p>Malaria is a mosquito borne infectious disease of human and other animals causes by protists, it begins with bites from an infected female anopheles mosquito (Churchill, 1998)., it is transmitted in large areas of Africa, South America, Middle East, Eastern Europe etc symptoms of malaria are characterized by cyclic occurrence of chills, fever and profuse sweating. This occur when the merozoite destroys the red blood cells causing toxin to be released into the blood. Its symptoms also includes headache, nausea, aneamia and jaundice if serve.</p> <p>Malaria is made up of types depending on the plasmodium involves. It includes tertian malaria caused by plasmodium, vivax fever, caused by plasmodium  falciparum. The life cycle of malaria parasite involves the cycle in the blood of man and cycle in mosquito (Obueh, 2003). Considering the magnitude of this problem, it therefore become very extremely important that this project work should be carried out to reduce the prevalence of malaria among children from 0 to 5 years old in Oredo Local Government Area, Benin City, Edo State. </p> <p>1.     <strong>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Malaria has become very common and is increasing in an uncontrolled way throughout Nigeria and world as whole, due to the bite of the female anopheles mosquito which carries the plasmodium in an attempt to eradicate this deadly disease, a massive response need to be mounted by the government to enlighten the public about the prevalence of malaria. Also provide remedy for treatment of it.</p> <p>1.     <strong>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The objective of this study is to determine prevalence of malaria among children from 0 to 5 years old in Oredo Local Government Area, Benin City, Edo State. The specific objectives of this study includes;</p> <p>1.     To determine the prevalence of malaria among children between 0 to 5 years in Oredo Local Government Area, Benin City, Edo State.</p> <p>2.     To identify the various means the vector transmits the parasite plasmodium.</p> <p>3.     To determine the symptoms and signs of malaria</p> <p>4.     To examine the ways to eradicate the prevalence of malaria among children from 0 to 5 years in Oredo Local Government Area, Benin City, Edo State.     </p> <p>1.     <strong>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were asked and answered in the process of study of this work;</p> <p>1.     Does lack of awareness contribute to the prevalence of malaria among children in Oredo Local Government Area?</p> <p>2.     Does poverty encourage the spread of malaria among residents of Oredo Local Government Area?</p> <p>3.     Can malaria lead to the death of children from 0 to 5 years old in Oredo Local Government Area?</p> <p>4.     Can poor sanitation among the residents lead to prevalence of malaria in Oredo Local Government Area?</p> <p>5.     Does the use of insecticides treated net prevent the prevalence of malaria among children in Oredo Local Government Area?</p> <p>1.     <strong>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This research work is very relevant in several ways to communities, personnel, individual, and government.</p> <p>The work will expose the prevalence of malaria and enlighten the community on t he effects of malaria among children in Benin City mostly in Oredo Local Government Area. Also it will proper measures for preventing this deadly disease. This study will also enlighten people on the signs and symptoms of malaria and how the parasite plasmodium invade the host body through the transmission by the vector mosquito.</p> <p>The study will encourage the government of Edo State to swing into actions by creating various measures to prevent further outbreaks of malaria among the resident of the states.   </p> <p>1.     <strong>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>This project work focuses on the prevalence of malaria among children 0-5 years in Oredo Local Government Area.

Plants in different species just sprout and grow anywhere.Vegetations remain to be the most important part of human existence.</p> <p>Medicinal substances derived from different plants around us have become the most sought sources of medicines. However, a considerable number of people in our generation still do not recognize the value and significance of medicinal plants.  Many people continue to rely on synthetic drugs for treatment of common illnesses despite their being expensive.</p> <p>Basically, the researchers had initiated a study that may provide appropriate answers to some common health problems experienced by human beings.</p> <p>Nowadays, skin problems also proliferate fast and are equally disturbing just like any other diseasesaffecting our communities.  This is the primary reason why researchers conceptualized this study to determine the anti-bacterial components of Neem (<em>Azadirachtaindic</em>a) leaves extract and its possible effects against <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, the bacteria that concerns most of the common skin problems.</p> <p>Neem is a tropical tree that has been declared non-toxic to humans. Previous studies revealed that it contains anti-bacterial properties and high-content of anti-oxidant called polyphenols. Neem tree extracts has an endodontic anti-microbial agent, an alternative to frequently employed Sodium Hypochlorite and Chlorhexide; both to inhibit the growth of endodontic pathogens.</p> <p>Sodium Hypochlorite is now used in endodontic during root canal treatments. It is the medicament of choice due to its efficacy against pathogenic organisms and pulp digestion. Chlorexide is a chemical antiseptic. It is effective on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.</p> <p>Staphylococcus aureus is facultative anaerobic Gram-positve coccus, and is the common cause of staph infections. It is frequently part of skin flora found in the nose and the skin. About 20% of human population are long –term carriers of<em> Staphylococcus aureus</em> can cause a range of illness from skin infection, such as pimples, impetigo, cellulitis follicutis, to life threatening diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, bacteremia and sepsis. It is still one of the five most common causes of nosocomial infections, often causing post-surgical wounds infection.</p> <p>This study mainly aimed at finding out the antibacterial effect of Neem (<em>Azadirachtaindica</em>) tree leaf- extract on <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. Further, it also aimed to find out whether Neem tree leaf extract has significant effect in terms of different levels of concentrations, namely: (a)25% concentration  (b)50% concentration (c)75% concentration (d)100% concentration on inhibition <em>Staphylococcus aureus.</em></p> <p>Due to the high cost of medicines, unpredictable weather conditions that brought  certain diseases specifically skin diseases, the continuous uplifting of herbal medicines and abundance supply of neem tree were the reason why the researcher conducted this study.</p> <p><strong>1.2 Statement of the Problem</strong></p> <p>This study aimed to determine the antibacterial effect of Neem (<em>Azadirachtaindica</em>) leaves extract against <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.</p> <p>It specifically:</p> <ol><li>Determine the significant difference among the different levels of concentration; (a) 25%, (2) 50%, (3) 75%, (d) 100% of Neem tree leaves extract on <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> as indicated by its zone of inhibition.</li> <li>Determine what sample treatment showed the widest zone of inhibition and the smallest zone of inhibition.</li> <li>Compared the effect of different levels of concentration of Neem (<em>Azadirachtaindica</em>) leaves extract on the zone of inhibition of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> to the control set-up.</li> </ol> <p>It was therefore hypothesized that:</p> <p>There is no significant difference between the levels of concentration: (a) 25%, (b) 50%, (c) 75%, (d) 100% of Neem leaves extract on <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> as indicated by its zone of inhibition.</p> <p><strong>1.3 Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>The anti-bacterial effect of Neem (<em>Azadirachtaindica</em>) leaves extract against <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, will be a great help in discovering a herbal medicine.</p> <p>More specifically, it is beneficial on the following context:</p> <p>Community- they can obtain a cheaper medicine using a herbal plant within their place and they can resort to the Neem Tree.</p> <p>Filipino people- herbal medicine can be afford by almost all of us due to its abundance in the community.</p> <p>Department  ofAgriculture- they will benefit on the ideas and knowledge that Neem tree can be used as an anti-bacterial medicine.</p> <p>Department  of Health – ideas and facts can be presented about the Neem tree that can be used as a medicine.</p> <p>Pharmaceutical companies- a cheaper medicine will be sold and they would gain on it and they would take the idea for herbal medicine.</p> <p>Students- they could gain ideas about plants and can be used as a medicine and they can conduct further studies and researchers in relation to this study.</p> <p>Researchers- fellow researchers can get ideas and information about the uses of Neem tree especially in inhabiting bacterial growth.

Seven (7) research questions were formulated and questionnaires were administered to one hundred and fifty (150) respondents in order to gather data for the research. Results showed that poor environmental sanitation leads to cholera outbreak, washing of hands before eating help to prevent cholera outbreak, drinking and batting with contaminated water leads to cholera infection and also, poorly kept toilet causes cholera outbreak etc. recommendations included that; government should swing into action by providing various measures in other to prevent cholera disease in the country, our water should be treated properly by adding chlorine before drinking and batting with it.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>1.0    INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1    BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY </strong></p> <p>Cholera is an infection of the small intestine that is caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae 01 and 0139 (Riyan 2004 &amp; WHO 2010). The main symptoms are profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting. Transmission is primarily through consuming contaminated drinking water or food. The severity of the diarrhea and vomiting can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Every year there is an estimated 3-5 million cholera cases and 100,000-120,000 deaths due cholera. The short incubation period of two to five days, enhance the potentially explosive pattern of out breaks (Faruque 2008 and WHO 2010). Cholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate environmental management. Typical at-risk areas include peri-urban slums, where basic infrastructure is not available, as well as camps for internally displaced people or refugees, where minimum requirements of clean water and sanitation are not met.  The consequences of a disaster – such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations to inadequate and overcrowded camps – can increase the risk of cholera transmission should the bacteria be present or introduced. Epidemics have never arisen from dead bodies. Cholera remains a global threat to public health and a key indicator of lack of social development. Recently, the reemergence of cholera has been noted in parallel with the ever-increasing size of vulnerable populations living in unsanitary conditions (Emch 2008 and WHO, 2010).</p> <p>Two serogroups of v. cholera - 01 and 0139 - causes out breaks (Alexander 2008).  v. cholera 01 causes the majority of outbreak, while 0139  -first indentified in Bangladash in 1992 –is confined to South-East Asia. Non-01 and non-0139 v. cholera can cause mild diarrhea but dot not generate epidemics. The bacteria are transmitted via contaminated drinking water or food.  Pathogenic v. cholera can survive refrigeration and freezing in food supplies. (Reildl et al 2002) The dosage of bacteria required to cause an infection in healthily volunteers via oral administration of living vibrios is greater than  1000 organisms (Hartely 2006 ).  After consuming an antacid, however, cholera development in most volunteers after consumption of only  100 cholera  vibrios experiments also show that  vibrios</p> <p>consumed with food are more likely to cause infection than those from water alone (Finkelstein 1996). Cases tend to be clustered by location as well as season, with most infections occurring in children ages 1-5 years (WHO 2010). </p> <p>      Cholera is severe water-born infectious disease caused by the bacterium  vibrio cholerae.   In 2005, 131,943 cases including 2,272 deaths have notified from 52 countries. The year was marked by a particular significant series of outbreaks in West Africa, which affected 14 countries and accounted for 58% of all cholera cases world-wide (WHO 2006). In the same year Nigeria had 4,477 cases and 174 deaths. There was reported case of cholera in 2008 in Nigeria in which 429 death out of 6,330 cases. More so, 2,304 cases in Niger State in which 114 were reported death in 2008 (NBS 2009). Recent years have seen a strong trend of cholera outbreak in developing countries, including among others, those in India (2007), Iraq (2008), Congo (2008), Zimbabwe (2008-2009), Haiti (2010), Kenya (2010). Koko in Edo State (1989). In Nigeria, according to UN figure, 1,555 people have died since January and 38,173 cases have been reported. The figure is more than four times the death toll the government reported in August (Guardian. 2010)</p> <p>Cholera is a disease characterized by profuse diarrhea accompanied with a severe dehydration and loss of electrolyte (Colwell and Huq, 1994), caused by toxigenic Vibrio cholerae, a serologically diverse, environmental, and gram-negative rod bacterium (Li et al., 2002). In the absence of appropriate treatment, there is a high mortality rate. Cholera is a major public health concern because of its high transmissibility, death-to-case ratio and ability to occur in epidemic and pandemic forms (Kaper et al., 1995). Cholera is responsible for an estimated death of 120,000 globally every year (WHO, 2001), and still continues to be a scourge worldwide covering all continents. In developing countries with endemic areas, cholera is still very significant with incidence of more than five million cases per year (Tauxe et al., 1994; Lan and Reeves, 2002). The explosive epidemic nature and the severity of the disease and the potential threat to food and water supplies have prompted the listing of V. cholerae as an organism of biological defense research (Zhang et al., 2003). In an epidemic, the great majority of cases can be recognized by clinical diagnosis easily and a bacteriological diagnosis is often not required.</p> <p>Cholera is endemic in Nigeria (Falade and Lawoyin, 1999) and epidemiological features (Utsalo et al., 1991, 1992; Eko et al., 1994; Hutin et al., 2003) have been reported from various parts of the country with investigations on possible sources of outbreaks. Outbreaks of cholera had been reported from various State in Nigeria such as Ogun, Edo, Pleatue State etc, of Nigeria. Investigations on outbreak of cholera in Nigeria have focused on the epidemiological features, the probable source of contamination and the risk factors without spatial linkage of health data. However, advances in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology provides this opportunity and have become an indispensible tool for processing, analyzing and visualizing spatial data within the domains of environmental health, disease ecology and public health (Kistemann et al., 2002).</p> <p>The use of GIS is not new in waterborne disease outbreaks and cholera studies. It has been applied in investigating waterborne disease outbreak (NWW, 1999), microbial risk assessment of drinking water reservoirs (Kistemann et al., 2001a), drinking water supply structure (Kistemann et al., 2001b), and spatial patterns of diarrhoea illness with regards to water supply structures (Dangendorf et al., 2002). In cholera studies, GIS technology has been applied in studying the correlation between socio-economic and demographic indices and cholera incidence (Ackers et al., 1998), environmental risk factors (Ali et al., 2002a), spatial epidemiology (Ali et al., 2002b), health risk prediction (Fleming et al., 2007) and spatial and demographic patterns of cholera (Osei and Duker, 2008). This study seeks to assess the causes and effect of cholera outbreak in Benin City, Edo State.</p> <p><strong>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM </strong></p> <p>The threat of cholera rampaging through Nigeria has long been of concern to many. The crowded settings coupled with minimal water, sanitation, hygiene and health services, present a fearsome breeding ground for cholera to quickly escalate beyond control. In an attempt to avoid this worse-case scenario, a massive response needs to be mounted by the Government to enlighten the general public about the causes of this deadly disease and also ways to avoid the outbreak. Hygiene promoters should be employed to work every day, sharing information on how to avoid contracting the illness and the signs and symptoms of the disease.</p> <p><strong>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>The purpose of this study is to determine the causes and effect of cholera during rainy season in Benin City.</p> <p>The specific objectives of the study are:</p> <ol><li>To identify the cause of cholera in Benin City.</li> <li>To ascertain if cholera outbreak is usually rampant during the rainy season among children in Benin City.</li> <li>To identify the problems associated with the prevention of cholera in Benin City</li> <li>To determine the ways of preventing cholera outbreak in Benin City.</li> </ol> <p><strong>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>The following research questions were asked and answered in the study:</p> <ol><li>Does poor environmental sanitation lead cholera outbreak?</li> <li>Does washing of hands before eating help to prevent cholera infection?</li> <li>Can drinking and bathing with contaminated water lead to cholera outbreak?</li> <li>Does poorly kept toilet cause cholera outbreak?</li> <li>Is cholera outbreak rampant during the rainy season?</li> <li>Does the use of pipe borne water for drinking and cooking help reduce cholera outbreak?</li> <li>Does boiling of water reduce the risk of cholera infection? </li> </ol> <p><strong>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The research work is important in several ways both to the health personnel and the individual within the society. Firstly, this study will expose to us some of the causes of cholera outbreak in Benin City and also proffer ways of preventing cholera outbreak within our community.   </p> <p>This study will also be of importance to the health personnel and our local community health workers in the sense that it will expose to them the various preventive measures to put in place to avoid cholera outbreak in our community and Benin City at large.</p> <p>This study is also be relevant to the government by providing the number of cholera outbreak within the Nigeria economy and also presenting the figures of victims who dies as a result of this disease, by this the government will swing into action by providing various measures in other to prevent further outbreak of the disease. </p> <p><strong>1.6    SCOPE/DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY:</strong></p> <p>The study is set out to determine the causes and effect of cholera outbreak during rainy season in Benin City, Edo State.

Several parameters were determined. Colony counts of the yeast cells during coconut fermentation in cfu/ml showed the highest colony counts of yeast cells of 4.3 x 103 cfu/ml. the pH of the fermenting wine moved from 4.77 at 0hr to 2.79 at 168hrs suggesting it became more acidic and likely to be more  inhibitory to spoilage microorganism and gives fermenting yeast a competitive advantage. The temperature of the fermenting wine did not show major variation from time 0hr to 168hrs, however the specific gravity decreased with increased in time 0hr to 168hrs. The alcoholic content was 5.81 after 168hrs of fermentation period.

A study was undertaken on Parasitic Fauna from the housefly Musca domestica (L) across the University of Agriculture Makurdi Community. A total of 1,309 houseflies were collected using fresh fish as bait and the knockdown method, from three different localities and were examined for Parasitic Faunas using normal saline concentration technique. The highest fly abundance recorded was 613 (46.81%) from the students village, while the least recorded was 216 (16.50%) houseflies from the staff quarters. Nine parasites were isolated from the external body surfaces of the flies with the following frequency of infestation in their external surfaces respectively; Ascari slumbricoides 15(23.44%),  Entamoeba histolytica 19 (29.69%), Taeniasolium 9(14.06), Taeniasaginata 7 (10.94), Schistosoma mansoni 5(7.81), Enterobius vermicularis 5(7.81),  Hymenolepis nana 5(7.81), Schistosoma haematobium 2(3.13) Trichuris trichiura 1(1.56%) and the frequencies from three sampling sites were (16.50%) for the Staff quarters, (36.67%)  for the Female hostel and (46.81%) for the Student’s village. Housefly was found to be a potential mechanical carrier of parasitic infections and significantly contribute to the spread of food borne parasitic diseases, since this study detected the presence of nine parasites in flies’ exoskeleton and therefore its role in disease transmission cannot be over emphasized.</em></p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p> <p><strong>1.1     Background Information</strong></p> <p>The housefly <em>Muscado mestica</em> is a fly of the order <em>Diptera</em>, it is the most common of all domestic flies, accounting for about 91% of family <em>Muscidae </em>and indeed one of the most widely spread insects found all over the world (Jeffrey <em>et al., </em>2000). It is considered a pest that can carry pathogens responsible for diseases (Scott <em>et al., </em>2014). Houseflies <em>Muscadomestica L</em>. are ubiquitous (found everywhere) and transmit more than 100 human and animal diseases, including bacterial infections such as salmonellosis, anthrasophthalmia, shigellosis, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, cholera and infantile diarrhea (Jeffrey <em>et al</em>., 2000). It is considered one of the most important pests which cause health problems in the environment as it accompanies human during their daily activity everywhere, on work site or in rest places causing many disturbances to them (Howard, 2011).</p> <p>Houseflies are of human and veterinary concern, because it acts as a mechanical vector for a range of pathogens (Peter and Chiodui, 1997). An almost invisible dot of feces in the environment may contain the eggs or larvae that can develop further and transmit to nearby humans (Graczyk <em>et al</em>., 2001).</p> <p>It has been reported by regulatory agencies concerned with sanitation that and public health that housefly are associated with unsanitary condition and involved in dissemination of human enteropathogens that serve as causative agents of gastro-intestinal diseases to humans, based on strong attraction of filth and human food (Otronto and Tarsitano, 2003). The filthy breeding habit, feeding mechanism and indiscriminate travel between filth and food make houseflies as an efficient vector and transmitters of human enteric protozoan and helminth parasites such as cysts of <em>Entamoeba histolytica, Entamoeba coli, Giardia intestinalis</em> and oocyts of <em>Toxoplasma gondii, Isospora spp </em>and Egg or larvae of <em>Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichuria </em>(Graczyk <em>et al., </em>2001).</p> <p>The transmission of these human protozoan and helminth parasites by houseflies is predominantly mechanical, which occurs through mechanical dislodgement from external body, fecal deposition and regurgitation (Graczyk <em>et al</em>., 2005). Since houseflies feed on contaminated substances such as human and animal excreta, sputum, excretion from wound, the flies can carry pathogens from their spongy mouth parts, body and leg hairs, which is directly transmitted to the next visited site e.g. human food (Manzon and Sanchoz, 1997).</p> <p>Flies also transmit pathogens responsible for eye diseases such as trachoma and epidemic conjunctivitis and infect wounds or skin with diseases such as cutaneous diphtheria, mycoses, yaws and leprosy (Westley <em>et al</em>., 2014).</p> <p>House flies are always found in association with humans and human activities (Timothy <em>et a</em>l., 2014). They are also one of the most serious pests with animal production facilities worldwide (Timothy <em>et al</em>., 2014). Insecticide has been used extensively for controlling house flies for a century and this pest has shown a remarkable ability to rapidly evolve resistance (Timothy <em>et al</em>., 2014).</p> <p>Despite the awareness of many about the dangers posed by houseflies, the inability to maintain a good sanitation leads to an increase in the population of houseflies, especially in warm tropical countries. In Makurdi, in general and Federal University of Agriculture in particular, poor sanitation is becoming a problem. Indiscriminate refuse dumping, little or no care of toilet facilities and drainage systems coupled with improper handling of food are daily on the increase. Hence, the aim of this study is to identify the Parasitic Fauna found on houseflies <em>Muscadomestica </em>across the Federal University of Agriculture Makurdi Benue States’ Community. In order to assess the dominant type of transmissible infectious agents present in the community.</p> <p><strong>1.2</strong>     <strong>Scope of the Study</strong></p> <p>The Community of Federal University of Agriculture Markudi Benue state Nigeria has been chosen for this study because it is one of the communities with high population of house flies.</p> <p><strong>1.3</strong>     <strong>Significance of the Study</strong></p> <p>This study on the parasitic fauna from the house fly Musca domestica across the University of Agriculture community Benue state Nigeria will suggest possible control in preventive measures against house flies as vectors of parasitic fauna in the area of study.</p> <p><strong>1.4</strong>     <strong>Aim and Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study was to identify the Parasitic Fauna on Houseflies across the University Community.

It is the most common pathogenic protozoan infection of humans in industrialized countries. Infection rates between men and women are similar with women being symptomatic, while infections in men are usually asymptomatic. Transmission usually occurs via direct, skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual, most often through sexual intercourse. The WHO has estimated that 160 million cases of infection are acquired annually worldwide. The estimates for North America alone are between 5 and 8 million new infections each year, with an estimated rate of asymptomatic cases as high as 50%. Usually treatment consists of metronidazole and tinidazole.</p> <p>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are spread primarily through person-to-person sexual contact: anal, vaginal and oral sexual contact. According to the most recent data available of WHO estimates, that 340 million new cases of curable STIs (Syphilis, Gonorrhea,   Chlamydia   and   Trichomoniasis) occur annually throughout the world in adults aged 15 – 49 years (WHO, 2001). Considering Trichomonas Vaginalis worldwide infections, 12 million cases occur annually with a high number of 4 million cases encountered in sub-Saharan Africa. Notably, Trichomonas vaginalis caused infection is believed to increase the risk of HIV transmission. Trichomoniasis is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, infertility,  postoperative infections, and cervical neoplasia (Soper, 2004). Trichomoniasis is the major   problem   in developing countries, where parental testing and antibiotics use are not adequately available. According to the African Humanitarian Action (AHA) report of July 2008, high rates of the commonly encountered sexually transmitted infections, in KRC, have been noticed by the 19 new cases of STIs, including Trichomonas vaginalis (Kiziba Refugee Camp Health Center, 2008). On the other hand, according to the recent information from CHUK laboratory, a high number of Trichomoniasis cases were observed each month among the patients visiting the health institution.</p> <p>In women, the disease encompasses broad range of symptoms ranging from a severe inflammation and irritation with frothy malodorous discharge to a relatively asymptomatic carrier state. But the main clinical manifestation of trichomoniasis is vaginitis, urethritis and prostatitis. The outcome of infection with Trichomonas may be due to genetic variability of the isolates and the host immune response.</p> <p>The vagina is the most common site of infection in women and the urethra (urine canal) is the most common site   of   infection    in   men.   The   parasite    is   sexually transmitted through penis-to-vagina intercourse or vulva­ to-vulva (the genital area outside the vagina) contact with an infected partner.  Women can acquire the disease from infected men or women, but men usually contract it only from infected women. Pregnant  women with trichomoniasis    may  have  babies  who  are  born  early  or with  low  birth  weight  (low  birth  weight  is less than  5.5 pounds).</p> <p>Trichomonas vaginalis is an obligate parasite in that it lacks the ability to synthesize    many   macromolecules   de novo, particularly   purines, pyrimidines and many lipids.  These nutrients   are acquired   from   the vaginal   secretions   or through     phagocytosis     of    host    and    bacterial     cells.  Culture   media   for Trichomonas vaginalis therefore   need to include all the essential macromolecules, vitamins and minerals.  In particular,   serum is essential   for the growth   of trichomonads,    since it provides   lipids, fatty acids, amino acids and trace metals. In vitro, it grows optimally at a pH of 6.0-6.3, although it can also grow through a wide range of pHs, especially in the changing environment of the vagina. The presence of Trichomonas vaginalis in the vagina increases predispositions to mv seroconversion. The genital inflammation caused by trichomoniasis can increase   a woman’s   susceptibility to HIV infection if exposed to the virus. Having trichomoniasis may increase the chance that an HIV-infected woman passes HIV to her sex partner(s).</p> <p>Recent   literature   documents   that women   infected during pregnancy are predisposed to premature rupture of membranes,      premature labor and    low-birth-weight infants. Further, it may amplify HIV transmission. The organism   typically   elicits   an aggressive   local   cellular immune response, with heavy infiltration   of leucocytes, even in symptom-free patients.  In addition, in about 50% of    infected women, punctate hemorrhages can be observed. In an HIV-negative person, there are target cells available, as also access to blood   stream.</p> <p>In an mv­positive person, all this may expand the portal of exit for the virus  and  increase  shedding  of HIV-l in the  genital area. Thus, trichomoniasis may amplify   HIV-l transmission    by increasing   susceptibility   in an HIV-l­ negative   person   and the   infectiousness    of an HIV -1- positive patient.</p> <p>Few   studies have been published   on Trichomonas vaginalis.</p> <p>Buve  et al., (1975) confirmed  that the risk of Trichomonas vaginalis  is higher  in women  reporting  a greater  lifetime  number  of sexual  partners  in those with poorer  education  levels  and in women  with alcohol  dependency  while  McClelland   et al. reported  that the infection  was also more  common in   women    with    concomitant     cervicitis    or   bacterial vaginosis.  On the other hand, the use of condoms and progesterone-only contraceptive methods (depot­ medroxyprogestrone acetate or N orplant) was found to be associated with a lower risk of infection in a multivariate analysis model.</p> <p>Prevention   of trichomoniasis   has not been a priority due   to   lack   of   understanding     of   its   public    health implications   and lack of resources. For long it has been considered a ‘minor’ STD. It has been seen that women infected during pregnancy are predisposed to premature rupture of membranes, premature labor and low­birth-weight infants. Further, it may amplify mv transmission. The natural history of this organism, including its often symptomless nature and protracted carriage, play an important role in HIV transmission dynamics, especially where heterosexual behaviours and a high prevalence of mv obtain.  The pregnant women infected with this parasite may be at risk of an adverse birth out comes such as premature rapture of membranes, premature labour, low birth weight, and post – abortion or post-hysterectomy infection, as well as infertility and enhanced predisposition to neoplastic transformation in cervical tissues. As with other sexually transmitted infections, the Trichomonas infection can increase the risk of transmission of HIV infection.</p> <p>Transmission of Trichomonas Vaginalis to neonates during passage through an infected birth canal is also possible. In the foetus and the neonates, complications such as abnormalities of the major organ systems as well as infections in form of pneumonia and conjunctivitis may also occur. Neonatal infection is infrequently reported, but has been noted to cause urinary tract infection and vaginitis in infants. In addition, i infants   with   Trichomonas vaginalis c u l t u r e d   f r o m nasopharyngeal secretions have been reported to present with significant respiratory distress.</p> <p>Trichomonas vaginalis can be isolated in vaginal, prostatic or urethral secretions, semen and urine of infected individuals. The most commonly employed diagnostic methods are direct microscopic examinations of wet mount preparations (with a sensitivity of 38% – 82%), and culture techniques. Combination of both wet mount examination and culture has been recommended as being more effective in establishing diagnosis than either one alone. Direct examination of wet mount preparation of clinical specimen is the most rapid and least expensive technique for identifying Trichomonas vaginalis, hence the most commonly used. This method has however been reported insensitive for the diagnosis of the disease, particularly in male patients. Other methods include antigen detection methods, plastic envelope method, in-pouch system, cell culture, staining techniques, serological and DNA techniques.</p> <p>In Nigeria, there are some documented reports on the prevalence of Trichomonas infections among women, students, Commercial sex workers and in pregnant women, but no similar study on pregnant women have been done in our region (northeastern Nigeria) and possibly only one in the northern part of Nigeria.</p> <p><strong>1.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY</strong><br/></p> <p> i.        To determine the prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis among pregnant woman according to their age.</p> <p>ii.        To isolate and identify the causative parasite.</p> <p>iii.        To determine the prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis by marital status of the pregnant women.</p> <p>iv.        To recommend the possible ways of controlling and preventing the spread of the parasite via fomites, mother to child and sex partners.</p> <p><strong>1.3 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY</strong><br/></p> <p>This study was aimed to determine the prevalence of the Trichomonas vaginalis among pregnant women attending antenatal clinic in general hospital Gboko.</p> <p><strong>1.4 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Trichomonas vaginalis has neither been the focus of intensive study none of active control program and the negligent is likely a function for relatively mind of the disease.</p>\n\nPREVALENCE OF TRICHOMONIASIS AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PREVALENCE OF TRICHOMONIASIS AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN", "id": 11}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p><strong>ABSTRACT<br/></strong></p> <p>This research work is limited to Makurdi (Wadata and North bank) in Benue State. All the sheep and goats from different origins, in different age group and sex brought to slaughter house at the time of visit were targeted as study population, a simple random sampling method was employed in selecting 50 goats and 50 sheep, making a total of 100 samples. Standard laboratory parasitological techniques was used in this study including Simple test tube flotation, sedimentation technique, McMaster faecal egg count. Prevalence of endo and ectoparasitic infestation was significantly higher among Makurdi indigenous sheep and goats. The parasite include <em>Amblyomma spp</em> (male hard tick), <em>Dermacenter spp</em> (male hard tick), Dematopinus (biting lice), Hematopinus (sucking lice). Many factors may be responsible for this. It is revealed that most of the animals examined during the present survey had low to moderate parasitic infestation, suggesting that the infections were usually sub-clinical. It was recommended that appropriate gastrointestinal parasites (GIT) parasite control strategy is needed which should be based on cost effective studies to optimize production and more attention should be paid to sheep and goat internal and external parasites, epidemiology and control nation-wide.</p> <p><strong>CHAPTER ONE</strong></p> <p><strong>INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>1.1   BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY<br/></strong></p> <p>Grazing ruminants are affected by a range of internal (e.g. worms, fluke, protozoa) and external parasites (e.g. sheep scab). As a general rule these diseases are most prevalent in young, susceptible stock and usually occur at certain periods in their first grazing season. In contrast, sheep scab represents a threat to stock of all ages. Although most disease occurs in young stock, scab and fluke are primarily an issue in older animals (Moredun Research Institute, 2010).</p> <p>External parasitism results in poor quality sheep and goat products especially skins and lost income to producers. Common external sheep and goat parasites include ticks, lice, ked and mites. Some parasites feed on blood causing blood-loss anemia, especially in young animals. The result is unthrifty, poor-performing sheep and goats. A regular program of treatment and prevention of external parasites should be an important part of a flock health program. The benefits of an effective external parasite control program include increased comfort for animals, improved performance, and higher quality of products (Sileshe <em>et al</em>., 2010).</p> <p>In most sheep-raising areas, internal parasites (i.e. worms) are usually the primary disease affecting sheep and lambs (Susan, 2006). Sheep are more susceptible to internal parasites than most other types of farm livestock. Their small fecal pellets disintegrate very easily thus releasing the worm larvae onto pastures (Susan, 2006). They graze close to the soil surface and to their feces. They are slow to acquire immunity. It takes 10 to 12 months for most lambs to develop immunity to parasites. Sheep also suffer a loss of immunity at the time of lambing, which does not restore itself until approximately four weeks after lambing (Susan, 2006). Heavy stocking rates and insufficient pasture rest periods further contribute to the incidence of parasitic disease in sheep and lambs. Internal parasites tend to be much less of a problem under range-type conditions where sheep do not graze the same pasture twice in the same grazing season. They are also less of a problem in arid regions, because parasites require moisture for their development (Susan, 2006).</p> <p>Parasitism in sheep and goat is a substantial problem plaguing farmers across the nation. As gastrointestinal parasite infection is the most important limiting factor of sheep productivity, parasitism has a highly detrimental effect on the sheep industry (Jones, 2001). Outbreaks are most severe in warm, humid climates; the optimum temperature for larval growth is between 50° and 80° Celsius and the optimal rainfall is at least 5 centimeters. A climate that is too hot or dry can kill most larvae on the pasture. Larvae numbers peak in late winter and early spring. <em>Haemonchus </em>has a life cycle lasting approximately four weeks. When ingested, the larvae travel to the abomasum of the animal, where they burrow into the mucosa and develop into true adults in 21 days (Fitch, 2006). While in the abomasums, female adults can lay over 5000 eggs per day (Scarfe, 2006). Roughly 10,000 adult <em>Haemonchus </em>worms can kill a sheep. The eggs are deposited in feces. After approximately 24 hours, the eggs hatch on grass in pastures and under optimal conditions, become infective in five to seven days (Fitch, 2006).</p> <p><strong>1.2  STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM</strong></p> <p>Goats and sheep can be infected by numerous gastro-internal parasites; the effect of infection by gastrointestinal parasites varies according to the parasite(s) involved, the degree of infection and other factors. The two most important internal parasites are the protozoan coccidian (Dai <em>et al</em>., 2006) and the nematode <em>Haemonchus contortus </em>(Waller, 2004). The effect of parasitic diseases on sheep and goats include mortality losses, condemnation of meat, weight loss, depreciation of animal’s products and reduced resistance to other diseases as well as expenditure on drugs. Also they cause anemia, Economic effects in the damaged of the skin due to ticks and flies bites, costs of treatment, prevention and control of parasites and vectors.</p> <p><strong>1.3  JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY</strong></p> <p>Parasitism, and gastrointestinal nematode parasitism in particular, is arguably the most serious constraint affecting small ruminant production worldwide. Economic losses are caused by decreased production, cost of prevention, cost of treatment, and the death of infected animals. It is difficult by any major survey or other estimation to establish precise figures on losses incurred in production from infection and disease. Even minimal accuracy of loss estimates is difficult because production diseases or disorders may result from interaction with nutritional and environmental stresses, management methods, concurrent diseases, genetic predispositions, or other factors (Jim, 2004).</p> <p><strong>1.4       AIM OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of internal and external parasites infecting goats and sheep in Makurdi metropolis and to determine the types of internal parasites present, their intensity and their associated risk factors.</p> <p><strong>1.4.1    Objectives of the Study</strong></p> <p>i.            To isolate and identify some internal and external parasites of sheep and goats.</p> <p>ii.            To characterize parasitic infection according to sex</p> <p>iii.            To characterize parasitic infection according to age</p> <p>iv.            To characterize parasitic infection and infestation</p> <p>v.            To compare the prevalence of parasitic infection and infestation of both site.</p> <p><strong>1.5       SCOPE AND LIMITATION OF STUDY</strong></p> <p>This work seek to determine the intestinal and external parasite of goat and sheep.

The Baermann method of nematode extraction was also used in getting the nematodes and analysis of raw data was carried out. Results revealed that both treatment (single and mixed) caused reduction in the various growth parameter on the susceptible tomato plant which were significant different as compared to its control. Simultaneous inoculations of both pathogens caused high reduction in the growth parameters but were not significantly different from either of the pathogen alone resulting in an antagonism interaction. On the resistant tomato plant there were no significant different on the number of leaves as compared to its control. The mean galls rating were much lower on resistant tomato plant inoculated with nematode alone as compared to the susceptible tomato plant that’s has the highest gall rating. Simultaneous and sequential inoculation of pathogens for both plants followed this trend of decreasing order of mean galls rating; N+f, N+F and F+n, however, the dominance of one pathogen over the other was dependent on the rime of establishment of the pathogen. Tomato is consumed nearly in every housed hold in Benue State and Nigeria at large, owing to its high nutritive value and diversified use .The losses caused by these pathogens, however, can be averted through used of resistant varieties.</p> <p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>1.1 INTRODUCTION</p> <p>HISTORY AND ORIGIN OF TOMATO</p> <p>The word “tomato” comes from the Spanish tomate. It first appeared in print in 1595. A member of the deadly nightshade family, tomatoes were erroneously thought to be poisonous (although the leaves are) by Europeans who were suspicious of their bright, shiny fruit. It is edible, often red fruit/berry of the nightshade Solanum lycopersicum L. commonly known as tomato plant.</p> <p>The tomato is native to western South America and Central America, is one of the world’s most widely grown and processed vegetable crop (Thompson and Kelly, 1957). The species originated in the South America Andes and its use as food originated in Mexico, and spread throughout the world following the Spanish colonization of the Americas. It was first domesticated in Mexico and Cater and introduce to the Europe by Spanish in 1531. Its many varieties are now widely grown, sometimes in greenhouses in cooler climates. Tomato is consumed in diverse ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes, sauces, salads and drinks. It is botanically a fruit. It is considered a vegetable for culinary purpose but one exception is that tomatoes are treated as a fruit in home canning practices: they are acidic enough to process in a water bath rather than a pressure cooker as vegetable require. This dispute of tomato as vegetable and fruit has led to legal speculation in the United States. In 1887, U.S. tariff laws that imposed a duty on vegetables, but not on fruits, caused the tomato’s status to become a matter of legal importance. United states supreme court settled this controversy on 10thof May 1893 by declaring that the tomato is a vegetable based on the popular definition that classifies vegetables by use, that are generally served with dinner and not dessert [Nix v. Hedden(149 U.S. 304)] .</p> <p>The world dedicated 4.8million hectares in 2012 for tomato cultivation and the total production was about 161.8million tonnes and the average world farm yield for tomato was 33.6 tonnes per hectare in 2012 (FAOSTAT 2012). According to FAOSTAT, the top three producers of tomatoes (in tonnes) in 2012 are China, India and United States. China, the largest producer, accounted for about quarter of the global output, followed by India and the United States. For one variety, plum or processing tomatoes, California account for 90% of U.S. production and 35% of the world production (Hartz, etal.; 2012).</p> <p>Villareal (1978) reported that tomato production being a labour intensive programme requires about 42,000 man-hours for one hectare production as compare to 24,000 man-hours estimated for growing on hectare of rice in Nigeria. Consequently a large-scale tomato production can bring about rapid socio-economic transformation particular in the rural economy (Nkiru  Omeregie etal.; 2005). In Benue state, tomato production is limited to wet season with attendant shortage and high price during the dry season. The low production is attributed to high night and day temperatures which have a detrimental effect on tomato growth and fruits set and result in poor pollen formation and flower abortion leading to poor fruit yield. Irrigation is practise along rivers coast during dry season.</p> <p> 1.2    ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE</p> <p>The economic and nutritional importance of tomato fruits to Nigerians cannot be over-emphasized. It provides a source of food for man and a major source of income for many farmers who cultivate them for fresh produce markets (Aluko, 1989). It is consumed in diverse ways by man such as raw, as an ingredient in many dishes, sauces, salads and drinks. According to Nkiru  Omeregie etal. (2005), tomato is helpful in the development of rural agro-industries. Tomatoes contain the carotene lycopene, one of the most powerful natural antioxidants. In some studies, lycopene, especially in cooked tomatoes has been found to help prevent prostate cancer but other research contradicts this claim. Lycopene has also been shown to improve the skin’s ability to protect against harmful ultraviolet ray according to BBC news 28 April 2008 and has no effect on the risk of developing diabetes but may help relieve the oxidative stress of people who already have diabetes (Valero, Vidal  Burgos  etal.; 2011). A study done by researchers at Manchester and Newcastle universities revealed that tomato can protect against sunburn and help keeping the skin looking youthful (Maccrae, 2008).            Tomato leaves, stem and green unripe fruit of the tomato plant contain small amounts of the toxic alkaloid tomatine (Mcgee, 2009). They also contain solanine, a toxic alkaloid found in potato leaves and other plants in the nightshade family (Barceloux, 2009). Tomato plants can be toxic to dogs if they eat large amounts of the fruits or chew plant material.</p> <p>1.3      BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</p> <p>The fungi and root-knot nematodes are known to reduce growth and performance of tomato plant when they infect the plant singly.

Probably because, symptoms of infection are sometimes erroneously taken for other causes like nutrient deficiency, lack of moisture or worse still ignored (Idowu etal., 1990; Iheukwumere etal., 2007). One among the few studies on mixed infection effects are those of Iheukwumere etal. (1995,1996,2005,2007,2012). This studies by Iheukwumere as stated above however, dealt with other crops but not tomato. This in essence, necessitated this experiment to determine the mixed infection effects of Fusarium oxysporum and the Meloidogyne incognita on the growth and performance of susceptible and resistant tomato plant which will provide information on disease complexes in tomato crops in Nigeria. This will help to determined strategies to induce controls for prevention of these pathogens from invading and damaging our tomato crops and also bridging the information gap on the infection complexes of crops involving a nematode and a soil fungus, particularly tomato.</p>\n\nMIXED INFECTION EFFECTS OF FUSARIUMOXYSPORUM AND THE MELOIDOGYNE INCOGNITA ON THE GROWTH AND PERFORMANCE OF A RESISTANT AND A SUSCEPTIBLE TOMATO PLANT<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " MIXED INFECTION EFFECTS OF FUSARIUMOXYSPORUM AND THE MELOIDOGYNE INCOGNITA ON THE GROWTH AND PERFORMANCE OF A RESISTANT AND A SUSCEPTIBLE TOMATO PLANT", "id": 13}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<p>1.0 INTRODUCTION</p> <p>The seed of locust beans (Parkiabiglobosa) plant found growing in the Savannah Africa provides one of the popular seasonings in African diet. The nutritious and delicious food spice is popularly called “ogiri” in Igbo, “iru” in Yoruba and “dawadawa” in Hausa in Nigeria. It is heavily consumed in Nigeria, Ghana, Sierre Leone and Togo (Odunfa, 1985). It serves as source of protein for most of the people whose protein intake is low due to high cost of animal protein sources.Fungi Species</p> <p>The African locust bean tree, Parkiabiglobosaare perennial trees legumes which belongs to the sub-family mimosoideae and family leguminosae (now family fabaceae). They grow in the Savannah region of West Africa up to the southern edge of the Sahel zone 13°N (Campbell-Platte, 1980). The plant occurs in a wide range of Natural Savannah woodlands and ithas the capacity to withstand drought conditions because of its deep tap root system (Nwadiaroet al., 2015). A matured locust bean tree (20-30years) can bear about a ton and above harvested fruits. From experience, the tree can start to bear fruits from 5-7 years after planting (Musa, 1991). The African locust bean tree grows to about 20m in height and has bark evergreen pinnate leaves. Its fruit is a brown leathery pod of about 10-30cm long and contains gummy pulps of an agreeable sweet taste, in which lie a number of seeds. It is important indigenous multipurpose fruit tree. Parkiabiglobosa tree plays vital ecological roles in recycling of nutrients from deep soil, by holding soil particles to prevent soil erosion with the aid of its roots. It also provides shade where it is found (Campbell-Platte, 1980). This tree is protected by peasant farmers and rural dwellers for its many benefits. Its wood is a source of fuel energy. It helps to enrich the soils nutrient.Fungi Species</p> <p>The most important use of African locust bean is found in its seed which is a legume, although it has other food and non-food uses especially the seeds which serve as a source of useful ingredients for consumption (Campbell-Platte, 1980). It has been reported that the locust bean is rich protein, carbohydrate, soluble sugars and ascorbic acid. The cotyledon is very nutritious, has less fibre and ash content. The oil content is suitable for consumption since it contains very low acid and iodine contents. The oil has very high saponification and hence would be useful in the soap industry (Alabiet al., 2005). It has also been reported that the husks and pods are good for livestock (Douglass, 1996; Obiazoba, 1998). The locust bean tree is also important in medicinal practices in treatment of aliments such as bronchitis, pneumonia, malaria, diarrhoea and as poison for sore eyes (Farombi, 2003).Fungi Species</p> <p>Although microorganisms of all groups including bacteria, protozoa, algae, viruses, fungi together with insects and rodents play significant role in food deterioration, the most active and more versatile organisms that affect locust bean seeds and its products causing spoilage when stored are species of bacteria and fungi (Omafuvbeet al., 2000). They can occur on growing crops as well as harvested commodities leading to damage ranging from rancidity, odour and flavour changes and germ layer destruction (Cutler, 1991). In a study to identify the bacterial and fungal flora of deteriorated and maggot infested samples of fermented locust bean seeds, the isolated fungal species were identified as Aspergillusniger, Aspergillusflavus, Penicillium, Rhizopus and Candidaspecies. Parkiabiglobosa seeds are subject to degradation induced by diverse organisms including fungi which are among the most active microorganisms in these processes (Popoola and Akueshi, 1985). Microorganisms associated with fermented locust bean seeds have been widely studied (Odunfa, 1981; Ikenebomehet al., 1986; Odunfa and Oyewole, 1986; Ogbadu and Okagbue, 1988). Bacilli and Staphylococci were observed to dominate the fermentation together with a number of fungal species causing deterioration of this especially in storage in Northern Nigeria.Fungi Species</p> <p>1.1 AIM</p> <p>This study is aimed at DETECTING THE FUNGI SPECIES INVOLVED IN PARKIABIGLOBOSASPOILAGE.</p> <p>1.2 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES</p> <p>To isolate and identify fungi associated with locust beans (Parkiabiglobosa).</p> <p>To determine the pH, moisture content and titratable acidity of locust beans.</p>\n\nDETECTION OF THE FUNGI SPECIES INVOLVED IN PARKIA BIGLOBISA SPOILAGE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " DETECTION OF THE FUNGI SPECIES INVOLVED IN PARKIA BIGLOBISA SPOILAGE", "id": 14}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>ETHNOBOTANY OF CONTRACEPTIVES AMONG THE PEOPLE OF EJIGBO, OSUN STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Unwanted pregnancy followed by unsafe abortion can be avoided by using different contraceptive methods. Information on knowledge, attitude and practice of contraceptives among youth is particular important because of high rates of teenage and unwanted pregnancies as well as soaring STI and HIV.AIDS rates. Unfortunately, in Nigeria, the case is not different as significant proportion of youth who engages in premarital sex, either lack basic knowledge of contraception, or are ignorant about contraceptive practices. This study examined the knowledge, and use of contraceptive method among youths in Ejigbo of Osun state Nigeria.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>        Rapid rise in population has caused serious problems in the economic growth and all round human development leading to poverty in developing countries (Dabhadkar and Zade, 2012). Family planning has been promoted through several methods of contraception, but due to serious adverse effects produced by synthetic steroidal contraception (Bingel and Benoit, 1973 ;Bingel and Benoit, 1973), attention has been focused on indigenous plants for possible contraceptive effect.<br/>The importance of plants as a source of antifertility drugs has been emphasized by many researchers (Farnsworth et al., 1975; Yakubu et al., 2007).<br/>Herbal contraceptives and abortifacients are those plants used for birth control or in the prevention of pregnancy and for premature expulsion of a foetus from the womb. Many plants have been reported to have sterilizing, contraceptive and abortifacient properties (Bablola, 2009). Plants that have contraceptive and abortifacient properties may act through rapid expulsion of the fertilized ova from the fallopian tube, inhibition of implantation due to a disturbance in oestrogen - progesterone balance, foetal abortion, perhaps due to lack of supply of nutrients to the uterus and the embryo, and also on the male side through affecting sperm count, motility and viability (Ciganda and Laborde, 2003; Kaunitz and Benrubi,1998; Nounmi and Tchakonang, 2001).<br/>Antifertility agents obtained from indigenous medicinal plants would be of immense benefit especially to inhabitant of developing countries, since the cost of these drugs would be within their means (Goonasekera et.al. 1995).<br/>Moreover, major population of the country lives in rural areas and those people have not approach to the modern method of family planning. Traditional sterilization method based on herbal medicines is used to control population growth rate:  including abortion at initial weeks, preventing conception of making the either member of the couple sterile.<br/>Several plant product inhibit male and female fertility and may be developed into contraceptives. Even though, many indigenous plants have been shown to prevent the birth, only few plants have so far been investigated for antifertility activities. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has set up a task force on plant research for fertility regulation with an objective to find new orally active non-steroidal contraceptive compounds. Various medicinal plants extracts have been tested for their anti-fertility activity both in male and female.<br/>Several hormonal contraceptives have been developed and practiced till date but they did not meet the demand of developing countries as they are chemical based expensive, sophisticated and have some side effects, some herbal contraceptive have also been developed. But due to the problems, people are now looking for the use of herbal medicines against various diseases and for controlling fertility (Patil and Patil 2013). Nearly 80% of the world populations rely on traditional medicines for primary health care, so far it has lesser side effects and more effective than the chemical compounds (Kaur et al. 2011).<br/>   1.2    Statement of the problem<br/>Numerous herbs have been used historically to reduce fertility, and modern scientific research has confirmed anti-fertility effects in at least some of the herbs tested. Herbal contraception may never reach the level of contraceptive protection as the pill, but it offers alternatives for women who have difficulty with modern contraceptive options or who just want to try a different way. Very little is known about many of the herbs, or about long term side effects or safety concerns.<br/> 1.3    Scope of the Study<br/>        The project is being carried out purposely to examine and document the plants used as contraceptives. The study shall cover the problem associated with the use of modern contraception in developing countries and it will most base on Nigeria.<br/> 1.4    Purpose of the Study<br/>        The main purpose of this study is to investigate and document the plants used as contraceptive.<br/> 1.5    Significance of the Study<br/>This research study is hoped to be valuable to every Nigerian citizen and to the whole world at large.

It is the second leading cause of death among children under five years of age worldwide (BBS, Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics UNICEF, United Nations Children’s Fund, 2007; Larson, Saha, Islam, &amp; Roy, 2006). Global deaths from diarrhea among children aged less than five years were estimated at 1.87 million in 2004 (Boschi-Pinto, Velebit, &amp; Shibuya, 2008; Candy, 1987; Chiller et al., 2006; Khan et al., 2004; Larson et al., 2006). Seventy percent of these deaths are concentrated in 15 developing countries. Nigeria is one of these 15 countries and diarrhea is responsible for sixty-nine thousands diarrheal deaths (Boschi-Pinto et al., 2008). Diarrheal disease is still a major health problem in Nigeria. The government of Nigeria states that diarrhea kills an estimated 25,000 people annually, mostly children (IRIN, 2008). On a daily average, 180-200 diarrhea patients were admitted to the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research, Bangladesh (ICDDRB) hospital (IRIN, 2008). According to the ICDDRB hospital’s statistical surveillance from 2004 to 2008, the total number of children with diarrhea in this hospital was 5596. An average of 1119 diarrhea children (under five) was admitted there annually. Causes of diarrhea were viruses, bacteria and parasites (Mishra, Gupta, &amp; Yadav, 2004). Contaminated foods play a major role in the occurrence of diarrheal diseases. The transmission of infection occurs by direct contact with the agent, through oral–fecal transmission routes due to poor water quality, unhygienic behaviors, improper storage of food and inadequate sanitation practices (Halvorson, 2004). This may be because mothers lack of awareness about safe drinking water, hygiene practice, feeding children with hygienic food and defecation practices (IRIN, 2008).<br/>Diarrhea is a disease that can be prevented by avoiding contacting with causative agents, but children under 5 years of age are unable to protect themselves from these agents. They are under the care of their mothers; therefore the maternal preventive behaviors for children are very important. There are many studies showing the incidence of diarrhea related to maternal behaviors including hygiene practices, child feeding practices, safe water and defecation practices (Banda et al., 2007; Chiller et al., 2006; Gorter et al, 1998; Khan et al., 2004; Nanan et al., 2003; Osumanu, 2008). Mothers are the closest persons to children. Their behaviors toward their children need to be explored, especially their preventive behaviors. A previous study showed that maternal behaviors were found to be related to their perceptions (Pancharuniti, Shiyalap, Dung, &amp; Wongsawass, 2004). The results of Pancharuniti et al study carried out in Vietnam indicated that maternal health beliefs towards diarrheal diseases in children played a crucial role in their home management of acute diarrhea. Maternal perceptions on the susceptibility and severity of diarrhea and the benefits and barriers to maternal home care for diarrheal children were significantly correlated to maternal practices. Although diarrheal disease is recognized as a major problem in Bangladesh, no studies on maternal preventive behaviors of diarrhea in children and maternal perceptions have been conducted. Therefore, this study is carried out in order to explore maternal perceptions and preventive behaviors of diarrhea in children. The results of the study will be used to enhance maternal preventive behaviors of diarrhea in children, which will reduce the incidence of diarrhea in children under five years of age. It can also fulfill the gap in knowledge of maternal preventive behaviors in diarrhea of children in Nigeria. <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>The problems to be considered in this work include;<br/>What are the causes of diarrhea<br/>What are the effects of diarrhea<br/>How does diarrhea affect the nation?<br/>1.3    OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>        The purpose of this work includes the following;<br/>To examine the concept of diarrhea<br/>To examine the causes of diarrhea among children in Benin City.<br/>To examine the effect of diarrhea among children in Benin City.<br/>To proffer solutions to the causes and effect of diarrhea among children in Benin City.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The study is carried out in order to know the causes and effects of diarrhea among children in Benin City. This work includes the following;<br/>To stop the causes and effects of diarrhea among children in Benin City.<br/>To enumerate the causes and effects of diarrhea among children in Benin City.<br/>To provide suitable solutions of the causes and effects of diarrhea.<br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>Does effect of diarrhea lead to fever among children?<br/>Do poor sanitary conditions lead to diarrhea among children?<br/>Does eating of poorly prepared food lead to diarrhea in children?<br/>Does lack of health education lead to spread of diarrhea?<br/>Does overcrowding lead to spread of diarrhea in children?<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is set out to determine the causes and effect of diarrhea among children in Benin City. Therefore, the study is restricted to residents of Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>1.8    DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Asymptomatic: Asymptomatic is a person who carry a diseases that are usually capable of transmitting the diseases it means there are no symptoms.<br/>Cholera: This is an infection in the small intestine caused by the bacterium vibrio cholera. The main symptoms are watery diarrhea and vomiting. Transmission occurs primarily by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated by the feces (waste product) of an infected person, including one with no apparent symptoms.    <br/>Contamination: Contamination is the presence of a minor and unwanted constituent (contaminant) in a material, in a physical body in the natural environment, at a workplace etc.<br/>Hygienic: Hygienic recommended for different situation, what is considered hygienic or not can vary between different cultures, genders and etarian groups. Some regular hygienic practices may be considered good habits by a society through neglect of hygiene can be considered disgusting, disrespectful or even threatening.<br/>MICROORGANISM: An organism that is microscopic or submicroscopic or submicroscopic which means it is too small to be seen by the unaided human eye.  Microorganisms are very tiny one called organisms, viruses, fungi, and bacteria, and are found everywhere in the world.

Accounting information in this regard, was found out to be a facilitator of effective planning, control and decision making by management, especially now when business has become complex. Hence, a second accounting system is needed from which relevant information can be readily and accurately derived for use of management at any given time. <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE (INTRODUCTION)       <br/>Background to the study<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Research questions<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Limitation of the study<br/>Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO           <br/>Review of related literature<br/>CHAPTER THREE (Methodology and procedure)               <br/>Research design<br/>Population of the study<br/>Sample of the study    <br/>Sampling techniques adopted<br/>Instrumentation<br/>Validation of instrument<br/>Method of data collection<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR          <br/>Presentation of data and discussion of results<br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Summary<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendations<br/>REFERENCES     <br/>QUESTIONNAIRES     <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY      <br/>Eyitayo, Eyitayo and Akeju (2004) explained that accounting generally is a systematic process of measuring and reporting to various users, financial information, for decision making, regarding the economic activities of an organization or and accounting is different from book-keeping, which is making up for financial record and keeping them. This is more or less a procedural matter, and many informed person can carry on the matter. In any case, accounting metamorphosed from book-keeping, due to the need of emerging business environment, which has become dynamic and volatile the different industrial revolutions have boosted the use of accounting in large corporation business, and without an effective accounting system, there can be no meaning for measurement of those transaction that are involved in any business transaction. This project is aimed at educating people on the importance of accounting and its effects on management control of the organization. In this research project we will be looking at accounting as an information system the researcher will be examining the definition, the scope and function of account and how it affects management control.<br/>        Accounting has a dynamic nature, it has been defined in varied term, and the researcher will be looking into the definition and try to show that they are all talking about something. It is find a matter of semantics, the researcher will also be looking into what management control is, and various way it can be implemented in organization and finally, the researcher will be explaining how accounting can influence management control. Accounting has grown into a field of study as a result of its importance. The purpose of accounting is to provide information about the economy of an organization. It is the means of recording the fact of forecasting about the economic aspect of the organization activities and translating them into useful form for further action. The two main branches of accounting are financial accounting and management accounting while the former has to do with gathering information on the stewardship of the business to it’s owner or owners, the matter has which is the main area of forms in this research. Management accounting is most useful for internal decision. It varies from very broad, being ranged planning information for budget to very detailed cost analysis for cost control purpose; the purpose of management accounting is to help the goals. It is a formal looking process involving short range, and long range planning.<br/>        The most important thing a manager needs for decision making is information, it is important to know that when we are talking of accounting system we are all together looking at an information gathering system because it plays the role of an information service to manager and other relevant users of the information that gives the true and fair view of the organization. Accounting infor5mation facilitates effective planning control and decision making by management. Since business has become very complex, and effective sound accounting system is headed from which accounting information can be readily and accurately derived for management use at any given time. Therefore makes accounting an important decision tool, which ensures that survival of an organization.<br/>        In problem solving, accounting information is a key factor, the reason is that various alternatives methods of problem solving usually have specific cost benefit implication that can be measured. Accounting is generally responsible for gathering available cost benefit data and for communicating it in a usable form to the appropriate authority for decision making. Therefore if accounting information form a basis of management decisions it requires astuteness and skill for effective control of the operation of a business especially now that business is both dynamic and volatile.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>        The main problem to be investigated in this study is to ascertain the effect of accounting systems on management control. Many institutions offering accounting programmes are being established following the failure of government to provide adequate education facilities for the school to survive competition in the future they must be able to control cost, prevent fraud and monitor collections.<br/>        The accounting system plays significant role in these activities, many directors of institute of continue educations have no accounting background and so if the school must not collapse there must be effective management control.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>To ascertain the adequate of accounting information system in the institute or continuing education and to what extent the accounting has helped in management control.<br/>It also serves as a basis of advice to director on the importance of accounting information in exercise or mana1gement control.<br/>To recommend key management control factors that the accounting system must address if the school will be able to compete effectively in the future.<br/>To provide information about economy of an organization.   <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>To educate the public generally on the necessity of accounting information.<br/>To educate the businessmen and businesswomen and on the necessity of accounting information in their business.<br/>To educate the non-profit making organization, even to the house wife who can implement or evolve a system of accounting for the management of the house.<br/>To help the management to get an information, service to manage others relevant issues of the organization.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>Is there any account department in institutions?<br/>Are the account’s personnel adequate to cope with the operations of the institute?<br/>How many books of account are kept by the institute?<br/>Is there form of budgetary control system?<br/>What are the sources and application of funds?<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        This research work is only limited to the institute of continuing education (I.C.E) in Benin City.

Poor nutrition is as old as man’s existence on earth. Nutrition particular in protein and energy giving food which the world health organization (WHO) referred to as silent emergency is an accomplice in at least half of the 10.4 million children death each year. According to Awake (2003) poor nutrition covers a wide range of illness from under nourishment due to a lack of one or more nutrient such as vitamins and mineral deficiency to obesity and other diet related to chronic diseases. The world health organization (2003) reported that poor nutrition is not limited to children only. However, developed countries are not free from poor nutrition. All cells need nutrients to grow and work. Lack of vitamins, mineral calories and protein can weaken your immune system and make it less able to find and destroys germs. This means that people who are poorly nourished are more likely to develop infection. People who are malnourished either do not take in enough calories and nutrients, or the body can’t use the food it takes in. in that way, it can weaken the immune system. Poor nutrition can affect children performance in school and is consistently reported as one of the causes of most death in our country that is, in Nigeria. However, poor nutrition occurs as a result of deficiencies in all food nutrient that are being taken by us. This is both quality and quantity that lead to poor nutrition in man. If the food eaten by the person is very low in calorific value that may result to only a little energy supplied of the body or the immune system, this condition is also called marasmus.      <br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>This project attempt to investigate the causes and effect of poor nutrition in children under the ages of 15 years using Egor Local Government Area as a case study. In recent times poor nutrition causes a variety of different health problems in both adults and children. The major problem is that, they normally affect the children because they are in a period of rapid growth that increases the demand for calories and proteins for similar reasons. Poor nutrition can result from failure to eat enough or failure to choose the right kinds of foods. It is in view of these problems that the researcher has chosen to write on this topic with a view of making recommendations on amounts to consume from each food groups to attain proper nutrition.     <br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>To critically look into the causative factor that may be  responsible for poor nutrition affecting children in Egor Local Government Area.<br/>To gain an insight into the control of the problems affecting the children in Egor Local Government Area.<br/>To find out the effect of poor nutrition in the children that are in Egor Local Government Area.<br/>To find out the causes of low production of food affecting poor nutrition.     <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study is based on the assumption that;<br/>To create awareness of the effect of poor nutrition on children in Egor Local Government Area for better care for them.<br/>To give some light on the control of the factors affecting growth and development of children in the Egor Local Government Area.<br/>To examine poor nutrition, its causes and effect on the academic performance of pupils in Egor Local Government Area in Edo State.<br/>To determine the effectiveness on how this problem of poor nutrition will be reduced.    <br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>Does the level of education of parents contribute to poor nutrition in children?<br/>Is poverty a major causes of poor nutrition in children in Egor Local Government?<br/>Is it true that poor nutrition lower intelligence by 10 to 15 IQ?<br/>Does proper feeding of children play a significance role in developing children’s intelligence?<br/>Is it true that poor nutrition leads to the death of children? <br/>SCOPE OF STUDY <br/>This scope of study was carried out to the people in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State. Pregnant women and nursing women and young children (pupil under the age of 15 year old)<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>Balanced Diet: Balanced diet means choosing a wide variety of food and drinks from all the food groups. It also means eating certain things in moderation, namely Saturday fat, cholesterol, refined sugar, salt and alcohol. Balanced diet is also a diet that contains adequate amounts of all the necessary nutrients required for healthy growth.  <br/>Unbalanced Diet: Unbalanced diet is when you don’t get (at least) the minimum amounts of each food group every day. It is also a diet that has too much of some nutrients and not enough of others. <br/>WHO: It means World Health Organization<br/> Poor Nutrition: Poor nutrition is a deficiency disease in human that are directly and indirectly caused by the lack of essential nutrient in the diet.<br/>Marasmus: Marasmus is a progressive wasting of the body, occurring mostly in young children and associated with insufficient intake or mal-absorption of food. It is also conditions that deal with talking of food that are low in calorific value.<br/>Calorific Value: Calorific value is the amount of heat produced by the complete combustion of a material or fuel. It is also the measure of hearty power and is dependent upon the composition of the gas.  <br/><br/>\n\nCAUSES AND EFFECT OF POOR NUTRITION ON CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 15 YEARS: A CASE STUDY OF EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " CAUSES AND EFFECT OF POOR NUTRITION ON CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 15 YEARS: A CASE STUDY OF EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE ", "id": 18}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>COMPONENT OF YIELD OF OKRA PLANT (ABELMESCUS ESCULENTUS) A CASE STUDY IN OVIA SOUTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>The components of yield of okra fruits in terms of fruit length, weight, number seeds, number grooves and weight in Udoh and Okada markets in Ovia South West Local Government Area of Edo State investigated.

It was propagated through North Africa to the Mediterranean, the Balkans and India. It arrived in the Americans at Brazil (1688), Guinea and at New Ocean before extending in the United States up to Philadelphia in 1981.<br/>Okra apparently originated from geobotanist call the Abyssinian centre origin of cultivate plants an area that includes present day Ethiopia, the mountainous or Plateau portion of Eritrea, and the eastern higher pare of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The routes by which okra was taken from Ethiopia to North Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean Arabia and India. It has been commonly cultivated in Egypt for many hundreds of years no sign of it had ever been found in any of the ancient monuments. Since the Spanish moors and the Egyptians of the 12th and 13th centuries use an Arabic word for okra, it probably taken into Egypt by the Moslems from the East who conquered Egypt in the year 17th century, the plant was taken from Ethiopia to Arabic across the narrow red sea.<br/>Okra fruit is a true fruit because it develops solely from the ovary and its does not involve other flora part. Okra fruit is a simple fruit that develop from a single flower with monocarpous or syncarpous pistil. Okra fruit is dry dehiscent fruit, the fruit can split to release their seed due to dehydration of the fruit wall. The name “Okra” most often use in the United State and the Philippines is of West African origin and is cognate with “Okuru” in Igbo language spoken in Nigeria. Okra is often known as “lady finger: outside of the United State. In Bantu language, okra is called “Kingambo” or a variant thereof and this is the origin of its name in Portuguese (quiabo). Spanish, Dutch and French and also of the name “gumbo” use in part of the United State and English speaking Caribbean for either the vegetable or stew base on it. In India and often in the United Kingdom it is called Hindu name “bhindi” or “bhendi” in South and South East Europe it is known as banya (banji).<br/>Cultivation of okra starts from seed and it does not transplant well. The seed should be planted directly in the ground outside about 2 weeks after all danger of frost has passed. Here in South Central wisdonsin it means that it planted outside sometime between May 20th and May 30th. The basic rule is to keep plants separated from each other by about 15 inches plants in beds that are four feet wide by about twenty feet long. Make three rows, and plant seeds about 18 inches apart within each row. Okra seeds are relatively large and easy to handle. They also germinate well if the soil is warm enough. Plant the seeds about 18 inches apart within each row. Okra seeds are relatively large and easy to handle. They also germinate well if the soil is warm enough. Plant the seeds about half an inch deep, about three seeds at each spot. In most cases all three germinate. Okro needs warm weather to grow well. This means that in northern climates you may not have much of a crop some years. The main thing you can do to help is to keep the bed weed free and mulched as much as possible. Watering is only needed occasionally. Most varieties will start yielding about 60 days after planting. The flowers are large, pale yellow and fairly ornamental. Each flower blooms for only one day and eventually forms one okra pod. Pick the pods when they are approximately three (3) inches in length and picking the pods while wet may darken the skin, though the taste is not affected, typically it grows quickly, so you need to harvest every two days or so. The plants can eventually grow quite tall (5 feet or more), but will stop growing as soon as the temperature starts dropping down below 50 degrees.<br/>IMPORTANCE OF OKRA PLANT <br/>Okra helps to stabilize blood sugar as it curbs the rate at which sugar is absorbed from the intestine tract.<br/>Okra mucilage not only binds cholesterol but bile acid consuming toxins dumped into it by the filtering liver.<br/>Okra helps to prevent and improve constipation due to the absorbing water and ensuring bulk in stools.<br/>Okra facilitates elimination more comfortable by its slippery characteristics many people abhor.  <br/>HOW TO GROW OKRA <br/>Okra, native to Africa and a beautiful relative of hibiscus, was brought to North America in the 1600s. this tropical plant quickly become popular in the deepSouth both as a side dish and as a thickening forgumbo and stews it can however, thrive in any climate where corn will grow. Depending on the cultivar, the large-flowered, fast-growing plants reach 2 to 6 feet tall. Varieties with colourful stems and leaves, such as “Burgundy”, make attractive garden borders.<br/>PLANTING AND HARVESTING <br/>Okra needs full sun. it will grow in ordinary garden soil but does best in fertile loamy soil, particularly where a nitrogen-fixing crop, such as early peas, grew previously. In the south, plant the first crop in the early spring and a second crop in June in short season areas, start plants in doors 6 weeks before setting them out (3 to 4 weeks after the last frost date:. Sow two seeds per peat pot and clip off the weaker seedlings. When seedlings okra directly in the ground, wait until after the soil has warmed and the air temperature is at least 600f, use fresh seeds, and soak it over night or nick each seed coat with a file to encourage germination. Sow seeds ½ inch deep in light soil and 1 one inch deep in heavy soil, spacing is 3 inches apart in rows, 3 feet apart. Thin seedlings to 18 to 24 inches apart always leaving the strongest of the young plants.<br/> About 50 to 60 days after planting edible pods will start to appear they are tough when mature, so harvest daily with a sharp knife when they are no more than finger sized and when stems are still tender and easy to cut. Pick frequently and the plants will keep producing until killed by frost. Be sure to remove and compost any mature pods you might have missed earlier.<br/>Many people find their skins are sensitive to the pods prickly spines, so wear gloves and long sleeves when harvesting or plant a spineless variety such as “Clemson Spineless”.<br/>GROWING GUIDELINES AND PROBLEMS <br/>When okra is four (4) inch tall, much to keep out weeds and conserve moisture, water during dry spells. Every 3 to 4 weeks side dress with compost or feed with compost tea.<br/> Okra seldom succumbs to pest or diseases. Hand pick any stinbugs that appear, these light green, shield-shaped bugs cause miss happen pods. To control corn ear worms, cabbage loopers, aphids, or flea beetles, go to the top ten garden insects pests fusarium, wilt, a soil borne disease is sometimes a problem in hot region. If the disease causes leaves to yellow and wilt, pull and destroy affected plants. Crop rotation is the best preventive measure.<br/>PRODUCTION REQUIREMENT <br/>Okra is grown throughout North Carolina in home gardens and for commercial markets. It is a warm season crop that belongs to the cotton (mallow) family and should not be planted until the soil has thoroughly warmed in the spring. Okra is referred to as ‘cumbo’ in some areas.<br/> Well drained sandy loams high in organic matter are the most desirable. It is difficult to get good stands on heavy clays. Poorly drained soils may result in drowning of the plants. Okra is susceptible to several soil borne disease pests (nematodes, southern stem blight and wilts) thus crop rotation should be so planned to avoid these where possible.<br/> Clemson Spineless: Is a uniform spineless variety with medium dark green, angular pods. It requires 55 to 58 days from seeding to maturity.<br/>Lee: Is a spineless variety with deep bright green, very straight angular pods. The plant is a semi-dwarf type.<br/>Emerald: is a spineless variety with dark green, smooth, round pods. It requires 58 to 60 days from seeding to maturity.<br/>Annie Oakley: Is a hybrid, spineless variety with bright green, angular pods. It requires 53 to 55 days from seeding to maturity.<br/>Prelude (PVP) is a new open pollinated, spineless variety with very dark glossy green fluted pods. It can be harvested when pods are ½ to ¾ inches longer and still remain tender. It requires 50 to 55 days from seed and generally yields better than Clemson spineless.<br/> Before planting, have the soil tested and follow recommendations. If no soiltest was made a great recommendation would be to apply 25 to 30 ib nitrogen. 50 to 70 IB of P205 and 50 to 70 Ib K20 per acre and make two side dressing of 20 pounds nitrogen each, beginning when plants are 6 to 8 inches tall and again 2 to 3 weeks later. Additional side dressing may be needed if heavy rains occur. Do not over use nitrogen, since it can cause excessive vigor and poor yield.<br/>SPACING AND SEEDLING <br/>Space rows 36 to 42 inch as part with 12 to 15 inch as between plants. Seed should be chemically treated to reduce “damping-off” (seedling rot) and planted about one inch deep. To establish good stands plant 3 to 4 seeds per ft and thin. 6 to 7 Ib of seed are required to plant one acre, soaking seeds over night will hasten germination.<br/>CULTIVATION AND WEED CONTROL <br/>Okra is harvested over a long period of time and full season weed control is important. Where mechanical cultivation is necessary it should be shallow and only as often as necessary to control weeds.<br/> Harvested okra deteriorates rapidly and normally it is stored only for a short periods. If the pods are in good condition, they can be stored 7 to 10 days at 45 to 500f and 90 to 95% humidity. Upon removal from storage the pods must be sold relatively quickly. At temperatures below 450f okra is subject to chilling injury which results in surface discoloration, pitting and decay.<br/>SUN REQUIREMENT <br/>Growing okra requires full sun, at least six (6) to eight (8) hours per day, and warm temperatures. Okra thrives when temperatures get above 750f, and continue to flourish with temperatures 900for higher. There are a few cultivars that grow well in cooler conditions, such as north and south, which can be successfully grown as far North as Maine. Okra seeds can be started in doors four to six weeks before the last frost date, or sown directly in the garden once the soil temperature reach between 700f and 750f. Transplanting okra seedlings in the garden can be successful, but you must be careful not to damage the long tap root.<br/>PEST PROBLEMS <br/>If you see an insect on or near your beloved okra plants, do not rush for the nearest insecticide. For one thing, many insects are beneficial or at least neutral, but even if you are looking at an enemy, one insect does not make an infestation. It is best to identify the intruder and the level of damage it is causing before managing insect pests in gardens or farmland.<br/>Some common okra pests are;<br/>Spotted boil worm: The larvae of this moth attack the shoots of plant by boring into it. It also bores into the fruits which are rendered unfit for human consumption.<br/>Jassid: The adult and nymphs of this insect feed on the plants by sucking the sap. Leaves turn pale and curl upward. The cupping may be followed by drying leaves from the margins giving a characteristic symptoms known as hopper burn. Both boll-worm and jassid attack the crop from May to September,   <br/>Spider mite: The plants are considerably damaged and weaken and the adults and nymphs such the plant sap. In severe cases the leaves dry up and fall off.  <br/> Wilt: Th4 growth of the plant become stunted and the leaves growth, the stem turns dark, close to the soil surface and finally the entire plant.<br/>Yellow Vein Mosaic: During rainy season, it is a very serious disease. Due to clearing of veins, leaves look chlorotic. There is a yellow and mosaic pattern. Fruit production is adversely affected. Fruits becomes yellow and lose acceptability.  <br/>HEALTH BENEFIT <br/>The mucilage and fibre found in okra helps adjust blood sugar by regulating its absorption in the small intestine.<br/>The fibre of okra has many superior qualities in maintaining the health of the gastro intestinal tract.<br/>It helps reabsorb water and traps excess cholesterol, metabolic toxins and surplus bile in its mucilage and slips it out through the stool. Due to greater percentage of water in the bulk it thereby prevent constipation, gas and bloating in the abdomen.   <br/>It is also an excellent laxative treats irritable bowels, heals ulcers and sooths the gastro-intestinal track.<br/>It is a supreme vegetable for those feeling weak, exhausted and suffering from depression.<br/>It treats lung inflammation, sore throats and irritable bowel syndrome.<br/>Okra has been used successfully in experimental blood plasma replacement.<br/>Okra is good for atherosclerosis and the fruit is also good for constipation.<br/>For adding bounce to your hair.

According to Oichl and Datrymple (2009) when more than 50% of a community population are immunized against a disease, the possibility of epidemic is removed. Supporting this view, Ogbuibe (2005) pointed out that the entry point to be fill introduction of all elements of primary health care system, immunization against diseases in one of the fairly they elements of the child’s survival and development. The national programme of immunization was for certain target groups of the population mainly children within the large group of 0-2 years and pregnant mothers or women. It is target against the six deadly and childhood diseases. These diseases are tuberculosis, measles, poliomyelitis, tetanus, chicken pox and whooping cough. The high rate of mortality from disease preventable by immunization underscores the need for immunization was the most effective programme to reduce these diseases for which satisfactory immunization procedures have been established.<br/>When a disease is peculiar to certain area, health authorities may recommend immunization of all persons in that area particularly those who are likely to be exposed to it. To buttress this view, Anderson (2000) suggested that mass immunization against typhoid fever is not advocated but if an epidemic occurs in a community, health authorities may implore all susceptible persons to be immunized. The success of any immunization programme depends largely on the target population. It is pertinent to note that mothers are the persons in the issues of the children rearing pattern in our society whereby the mothers rather than fathers are the home keepers and know better about their children’s immunization status. Therefore, all children should be protected. All mothers should understand the importance of immunization to ensure this, Sohem (2005) recommended the vaccination of all new born children should be registered at all health clinics for routine immunization. This entails that they should undergo all stages of immunization.<br/>According to the oxford advanced learners dictionary (2004), immunization is the process of protecting an individual or animal from a disease especially by giving them an injection or a vaccine. Immunization is also defined as a process by which human beings protect themselves from, or against deadly diseases such as poliomyelitis, measles, tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough, vaccination is also another name for immunizing living things against deadly diseases. Immunization is done to make the body resist invasion of pathogenic microbes like bacteria, protozoa and virus. In immunization, a small quantity of a dead parasitic organism is injected into the body of a healthy person (somebody that is free from that parasite organism), the body recognized the antigen as foreign response by realizing specialized protein called antibodies. These antibodies have specific protective properties and the body become immune against the disease that are caused by micro-organisms. Immunization can be active, positive, natural, or acquired.<br/>        Immunization is the act of protecting someone against a disease by the intake of inoculation of vaccine or other protective agents which stimulate natural body resistance. It could be active or passive. Immunization is the active which involves administering agents which stimulates the receivers’ own immunological mechanism who responds by producing reactions in his resistance to infect by the organisms from which the antigen was derived or obtained. This takes several weeks to produce effective protection hence, it has a prophylactic value but last forever. On the other hand, immunization is said to be passive by the giving of already made anti-bodies formed by another lost in response to natural injection. This has immediate protective and therapeutic value but last for a short period.<br/>        Parent especially the mothers in question do not get their children immunized. The superstition belief or idea that disease are caused by witches and wizards are strongly rooted in their mind, some believes that diseases are caused by evil spirit and the only way out for them to avoid it is by offering sacrifice and some believe that it is the sin that the parents have committed towards the gods that make the child to be like that and there is no solution to the sickness of the child.<br/>        Some parent know where and how to obtain it but do not take their children to the clinic for immunization while others that made attempts to take their children to the clinic for immunization may start and will not complete the normal dose they are supposed to give to that child. In a particular health center, i.e. Ikpoba Okha Health center in Edo State, between January 2007 to December 2010, fifty six thousand six hundred and forty two (56,642) children were registered for different types of immunization. Out of these only thirty four thousand six hundred and twenty two (34, 622) children completed their immunization, the remaining twenty two thousand and twenty (22,020) fall to complete their immunization. Some mothers later brought their children to complete their immunization after a long time. When they asked them why they did not bring their children ever since, the most population reason they gave was that, they were not chanced due to their jobs. They devoted much time to their jobs e.g. trading, government workers etc others said they came several times but in most occasions, the nurses asked them to go home that the health of their babies was poor.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>        The decision to carry out the study was due to the problem associated with immunization of children among the illiterate mothers in Esan West Local Government Area. In the past, many children died before the age of 5 or before the school age due to communicable diseases e.g. tuberculosis, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, whooping cough, measles, tetanus etc. they did not know that these disease could be prevented. These communicable disease were discovered by scientific researcher, clinics are established where the disease can be  prevented by treatment. Many people are not still making use of the clinic and health center, perhaps due to ignorance, inability of mothers to get the facilities or non availability of vaccine or lack of understanding.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY   <br/>        This research work is an attempt to study the attitude of mothers towards immunization in Esan West Local Government Area in Edo State. The purpose of this study is to:<br/>To find out why mothers refused to bring their children for immunization<br/>To know why some mothers started but refuse to complete the normal schedule<br/>To know or find out how many children register in the clinic and health center for the immunization during the period of January 2010 to December 2010.<br/>To know the number of children who started the immunization and completed the normal schedule<br/>To know the number of children that started the immunization but refuse to complete it.<br/>1.4    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY    <br/>        This research is expected to be of great importance to parents and the general public in Esan West Local Government Area who will appreciate the implication of the problem of immunization and know the best way to handle them. The study conducted was done to aid the following group of people.<br/>The mothers<br/>The health center<br/>Ministry of health, Edo State.<br/>The Mothers: The mother will be advice properly on what they should do. The information gathered will be of great importance which may change mother’s attitudes towards immunization programme.<br/>The health center: The suggestion made will be used as a source of correction measure to health persons on one way or the other may have contributed to the lukewarm attitude of mothers when they bring their children for immunization through health education and lack of follow up visit to trace defaulters.<br/>Ministry of health, Edo State: The findings may serve as a clue for Edo State Ministry of health to make better plan by making of health to make better plan by making adequate provision of vaccine and training more people into the health sector to promote child immunization in Edo State.<br/>1.5    RESEARCH QUESTIONS    <br/>        Based on the assumption made, the following research questions are postulated.<br/>Does ignorance of mothers contribute to their attitude towards immunization?<br/>Does lack of immunization lead to death of children?<br/>Do mother get actively involved and delighted in the immunization of the children?<br/>Does the behaviour of health workers affect mothers in the immunization of their children?<br/>1.6    SCOPE OF THE STUDY   <br/>        This is restricted to the attitude of mothers towards immunization in some selected health centres in Esan West Local Government Area of Edo State.

The main symptoms are profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting. Transmission is primarily through consuming contaminated drinking water or food. The severity of the diarrhea and vomiting can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Every year there is an estimated 3-5 million cholera cases and 100,000-120,000 deaths due cholera. The short incubation period of two to five days, enhance the potentially explosive pattern of out breaks (Faruque 2008 and WHO 2010). Cholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate environmental management. Typical at-risk areas include peri-urban slums, where basic infrastructure is not available, as well as camps for internally displaced people or refugees, where minimum requirements of clean water and sanitation are not met.  The consequences of a disaster – such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations to inadequate and overcrowded camps – can increase the risk of cholera transmission should the bacteria be present or introduced. Epidemics have never arisen from dead bodies. Cholera remains a global threat to public health and a key indicator of lack of social development. Recently, the reemergence of cholera has been noted in parallel with the ever-increasing size of vulnerable populations living in unsanitary conditions (Emch 2008 and WHO, 2010).<br/>Two serogroups of v. cholera - 01 and 0139 - causes out breaks (Alexander 2008).  v. cholera 01 causes the majority of outbreak, while 0139  -first indentified in Bangladash in 1992 –is confined to South-East Asia. Non-01 and non-0139 v. cholera can cause mild diarrhea but dot not generate epidemics. The bacteria are transmitted via contaminated drinking water or food.  Pathogenic v. cholera can survive refrigeration and freezing in food supplies. (Reildl et al 2002) The dosage of bacteria required to cause an infection in healthily volunteers via oral administration of living vibrios is greater than  1000 organisms (Hartely 2006 ).  After consuming an antacid, however, cholera development in most volunteers after consumption of only  100 cholera  vibrios experiments also show that  vibrios<br/>consumed with food are more likely to cause infection than those from water alone (Finkelstein 1996). Cases tend to be clustered by location as well as season, with most infections occurring in children ages 1-5 years (WHO 2010). <br/>      Cholera is severe water-born infectious disease caused by the bacterium  vibrio cholerae.   In 2005, 131,943 cases including 2,272 deaths have notified from 52 countries. The year was marked by a particular significant series of outbreaks in West Africa, which affected 14 countries and accounted for 58% of all cholera cases world-wide (WHO 2006). In the same year Nigeria had 4,477 cases and 174 deaths. There was reported case of cholera in 2008 in Nigeria in which 429 death out of 6,330 cases. More so, 2,304 cases in Niger State in which 114 were reported death in 2008 (NBS 2009). Recent years have seen a strong trend of cholera outbreak in developing countries, including among others, those in India (2007), Iraq (2008), Congo (2008), Zimbabwe (2008-2009), Haiti (2010), Kenya (2010). Koko in Edo State (1989). In Nigeria, according to UN figure, 1,555 people have died since January and 38,173 cases have been reported. The figure is more than four times the death toll the government reported in August (Guardian. 2010)<br/>Cholera is a disease characterized by profuse diarrhea accompanied with a severe dehydration and loss of electrolyte (Colwell and Huq, 1994), caused by toxigenic Vibrio cholerae, a serologically diverse, environmental, and gram-negative rod bacterium (Li et al., 2002). In the absence of appropriate treatment, there is a high mortality rate. Cholera is a major public health concern because of its high transmissibility, death-to-case ratio and ability to occur in epidemic and pandemic forms (Kaper et al., 1995). Cholera is responsible for an estimated death of 120,000 globally every year (WHO, 2001), and still continues to be a scourge worldwide covering all continents. In developing countries with endemic areas, cholera is still very significant with incidence of more than five million cases per year (Tauxe et al., 1994; Lan and Reeves, 2002). The explosive epidemic nature and the severity of the disease and the potential threat to food and water supplies have prompted the listing of V. cholerae as an organism of biological defense research (Zhang et al., 2003). In an epidemic, the great majority of cases can be recognized by clinical diagnosis easily and a bacteriological diagnosis is often not required.<br/>Cholera is endemic in Nigeria (Falade and Lawoyin, 1999) and epidemiological features (Utsalo et al., 1991, 1992; Eko et al., 1994; Hutin et al., 2003) have been reported from various parts of the country with investigations on possible sources of outbreaks. Outbreaks of cholera had been reported from various State in Nigeria such as Ogun, Edo, Pleatue State etc, of Nigeria. Investigations on outbreak of cholera in Nigeria have focused on the epidemiological features, the probable source of contamination and the risk factors without spatial linkage of health data. However, advances in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology provides this opportunity and have become an indispensible tool for processing, analyzing and visualizing spatial data within the domains of environmental health, disease ecology and public health (Kistemann et al., 2002).<br/>The use of GIS is not new in waterborne disease outbreaks and cholera studies. It has been applied in investigating waterborne disease outbreak (NWW, 1999), microbial risk assessment of drinking water reservoirs (Kistemann et al., 2001a), drinking water supply structure (Kistemann et al., 2001b), and spatial patterns of diarrhoea illness with regards to water supply structures (Dangendorf et al., 2002). In cholera studies, GIS technology has been applied in studying the correlation between socio-economic and demographic indices and cholera incidence (Ackers et al., 1998), environmental risk factors (Ali et al., 2002a), spatial epidemiology (Ali et al., 2002b), health risk prediction (Fleming et al., 2007) and spatial and demographic patterns of cholera (Osei and Duker, 2008). This study seeks to assess the causes and effect of cholera outbreak in Benin City, Edo State.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>The threat of cholera rampaging through Nigeria has long been of concern to many. The crowded settings coupled with minimal water, sanitation, hygiene and health services, present a fearsome breeding ground for cholera to quickly escalate beyond control. In an attempt to avoid this worse-case scenario, a massive response needs to be mounted by the Government to enlighten the general public about the causes of this deadly disease and also ways to avoid the outbreak. Hygiene promoters should be employed to work every day, sharing information on how to avoid contracting the illness and the signs and symptoms of the disease.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this study is to determine the causes and effect of cholera during rainy season in Benin City.<br/>The specific objectives of the study are:<br/>To identify the cause of cholera in Benin City.<br/>To ascertain if cholera outbreak is usually rampant during the rainy season among children in Benin City.<br/>To identify the problems associated with the prevention of cholera in Benin City<br/>To determine the ways of preventing cholera outbreak in Benin City.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The following research questions were asked and answered in the study:<br/>Does poor environmental sanitation lead cholera outbreak?<br/>Does washing of hands before eating help to prevent cholera infection?<br/>Can drinking and bathing with contaminated water lead to cholera outbreak?<br/>Does poorly kept toilet cause cholera outbreak?<br/>Is cholera outbreak rampant during the rainy season?<br/>Does the use of pipe borne water for drinking and cooking help reduce cholera outbreak?<br/>Does boiling of water reduce the risk of cholera infection? <br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The research work is important in several ways both to the health personnel and the individual within the society. Firstly, this study will expose to us some of the causes of cholera outbreak in Benin City and also proffer ways of preventing cholera outbreak within our community.   <br/>This study will also be of importance to the health personnel and our local community health workers in the sense that it will expose to them the various preventive measures to put in place to avoid cholera outbreak in our community and Benin City at large.<br/>This study is also be relevant to the government by providing the number of cholera outbreak within the Nigeria economy and also presenting the figures of victims who dies as a result of this disease, by this the government will swing into action by providing various measures in other to prevent further outbreak of the disease. <br/>1.6    SCOPE/DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY:<br/>The study is set out to determine the causes and effect of cholera outbreak during rainy season in Benin City, Edo State. Therefore, the study is restricted to only community health workers, and other health related personnel in Benin City, Edo State.

At the beginning brief survey of non-communicable diseases among youths in Benin City was made, and the types of non-communicable diseases, the effects and their possible solutions were also discussed. One hundred and twenty (120) questionnaires distributed to the respondents. Results showed that the educational qualification of parents enhance the reduction of the incidence of non-communicable diseases among youths that the knowledge of health education help to prevent non-communicable diseases among youths and environmental factor increased the incidence of non-communicable diseases. Recommendations included that youths should deviate from excess intake of alcohol and tobacco and the government and health sector should organize seminars and training on non-communicable diseases.   <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE   <br/>Background of the study<br/>Statement of problem<br/>Purpose of the study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Research questions<br/>Scope of study<br/>Limitation of study<br/>Definition of terms<br/>CHAPTER TWO  <br/>Literature review<br/>CHAPTER THREE         <br/>Research design<br/>Population of the study<br/>Sample of the study<br/>Sample techniques adopted<br/>Instrumentation<br/>Validity of instrument<br/>Method of data collection<br/>Method of data analysis<br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/>Data analysis and presentation<br/>CHAPTER FIVE  <br/>Summary<br/>Conclusion<br/>Recommendation<br/>REFERENCES     <br/>QUESTIONNAIRE       <br/> CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>It is indisputable true that man has almost complete dominion over all things on earth, yet he has remained subjected to physical, biological and social environmental problems which he created. Non-communicable diseases (NCDS), also known as chronic diseases are not contagious or transferable from one person to person. But it is contacted individually; they are four main types of non-communicable diseases that occur among the youths which are cardiovascular diseases (like heart attack and stroke), cancers, and chronic reparatory diseases (such as chronic obstructed pulmonary diseases and asthma) and diabetes, and others include hypertension, trauma, mental disorder, fractures, malnutrition, poisoning, fibromyalgia etc which in effect leads to damage of vital cells and tissues which may even leads to death. Non-communicable diseases have many different causes but they are never caused by bacterial, germs or other living organisms that attack the body, they are never spread from one person to person (WHO,  2002 and 2010).<br/>In the year 2010, there was an estimated number of 80 million deaths globally, of which 90% was due to non-communicable diseases, 1.7 millions deaths was as a result from  cardiovascular diseases (CVD) especially coronary heart diseases (CHD), and stroke, 7.6 million from cancer, 42 million from chronic respiratory diseases, and almost 1.3 million from diabetes (WHO Global Status Report on Non-Communicable Diseases, 2010:411). Mental health problems are leading contributions to the burden of disease in many countries and contributes substantially to the incidence and severity of many non-communicable diseases including VUD and cancer.<br/>Non-communicable diseases contribute substantially to youth (adult) mortality. It adds to health inequalities within Benin City, mainly affecting population largely because of inequalities in the distribution of major risk factor (Mackenbach, 2004). This topic will enhance the youths in Benin City on how to prevent and control the causes of non-communicable diseases among them. Especially through the making in of tobacco and alcohol which damages the respiratory system and heart against the pumping of oxygenated blood for the use of the body.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>The problem associated with non-communicable diseases among youths in Benin City varies from one person to another. Health problem are associated with poverty, poor diet, and lack of essential resources among these are inadequate clean water, shelter, food, educational orientation and clean air. In addition, many developing countries and poor population are facing health problems. This is true of diseases especially non-communicable diseases. Globalization is an important determinant of non-communicable diseases epidemics since it has direct effects on national economic and health system (Moffow, R. H.,  2002).<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The purpose of this study is to examine the cause and effects of non-communicable diseases among youths in Benin City. Also to determine the  ways which they can be prevented, controlled and treated. <br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>Does environmental factors increase the incidence of non-communicable disease among youths?<br/>Does the knowledge of health education help to prevent and control non-communicable diseases among youths?<br/>Does the educational qualification of parents enhances the reduction of the incidence of non-communicable diseases among youths?<br/>Do non-communicable diseases increases as a result of life style like intake of tobacco?<br/>Does poverty of parents and lack of essential resources in the community increase the incidence?<br/>Does parental gene increase the incidence of non-communicable diseases among youths? <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The findings of this research will be beneficial to youths, students, parents, school administrators, health institutions and other concerned individuals. It will help to educate youths and create awareness about non-communicable diseases, the causes and effects and possible prevention and controls. It will enlighten the government and the ministry of education and the health sectors the need for seminars and training on non-communicable diseases.  <br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>This study is restricted to causes and effects of non-communicable diseases among youths in Benin City. The investigation is restricted to the following areas and quarters in Benin City.<br/>Ogbe Street<br/>Ebiwe Street<br/>Marine Street<br/>Obazee Street<br/>Plymount Street<br/>Uzama Street <br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Asthma: This is the condition of subjects with wide spread narrowing of the bronchial air ways which changes in severity over short period of time (either spontaneously or under treatment) and leads to cough, wheezing and difficulty in breathing.<br/>Cancer: This is a way malignant tumor, including carcinoma and sarcoma.

Malaria has also been one of the world’s worst killer diseases throughout recorded human history. Despite attempt to eradicate it, it remains one of the worst disease in terms of death annually.<br/>Malaria parasite was discovered in 1886 by Laveran a military physician working in Constantine Algeria (Ksogstad, 1996). Malaria is a serious notificable infectious illness characterized by periodic chills, fever, sweating and sptemomeguly. It has serious and often fatal complications which gave way to Falciparom malaria. It is intermittent and remittent fever caused by a protozoa parasite that incades the red blood cells. Malaria is a preventable and treatable disease of public health. Malaria is by far the most important insect transmitting disease (Curtis, 1991).    <br/>Malaria is a mosquito borne infectious disease of human and other animals causes by protists, it begins with bites from an infected female anopheles mosquito (Churchill, 1998)., it is transmitted in large areas of Africa, South America, Middle East, Eastern Europe etc symptoms of malaria are characterized by cyclic occurrence of chills, fever and profuse sweating. This occur when the merozoite destroys the red blood cells causing toxin to be released into the blood. Its symptoms also includes headache, nausea, aneamia and jaundice if serve.<br/>Malaria is made up of types depending on the plasmodium involves. It includes tertian malaria caused by plasmodium, vivax fever, caused by plasmodium  falciparum. The life cycle of malaria parasite involves the cycle in the blood of man and cycle in mosquito (Obueh, 2003). Considering the magnitude of this problem, it therefore become very extremely important that this project work should be carried out to reduce the prevalence of malaria among children from 0 to 5 years old in Oredo Local Government Area, Benin City, Edo State. <br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Malaria has become very common and is increasing in an uncontrolled way throughout Nigeria and world as whole, due to the bite of the female anopheles mosquito which carries the plasmodium in an attempt to eradicate this deadly disease, a massive response need to be mounted by the government to enlighten the public about the prevalence of malaria. Also provide remedy for treatment of it.<br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The objective of this study is to determine prevalence of malaria among children from 0 to 5 years old in Oredo Local Government Area, Benin City, Edo State. The specific objectives of this study includes;<br/>To determine the prevalence of malaria among children between 0 to 5 years in Oredo Local Government Area, Benin City, Edo State.<br/>To identify the various means the vector transmits the parasite plasmodium.<br/>To determine the symptoms and signs of malaria<br/>To examine the ways to eradicate the prevalence of malaria among children from 0 to 5 years in Oredo Local Government Area, Benin City, Edo State.      <br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>The following research questions were asked and answered in the process of study of this work;<br/>Does lack of awareness contribute to the prevalence of malaria among children in Oredo Local Government Area?<br/>Does poverty encourage the spread of malaria among residents of Oredo Local Government Area?<br/>Can malaria lead to the death of children from 0 to 5 years old in Oredo Local Government Area?<br/>Can poor sanitation among the residents lead to prevalence of malaria in Oredo Local Government Area?<br/>Does the use of insecticides treated net prevent the prevalence of malaria among children in Oredo Local Government Area? <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research work is very relevant in several ways to communities, personnel, individual, and government.<br/>The work will expose the prevalence of malaria and enlighten the community on t he effects of malaria among children in Benin City mostly in Oredo Local Government Area. Also it will proper measures for preventing this deadly disease. This study will also enlighten people on the signs and symptoms of malaria and how the parasite plasmodium invade the host body through the transmission by the vector mosquito.<br/>The study will encourage the government of Edo State to swing into actions by creating various measures to prevent further outbreaks of malaria among the resident of the states.   <br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>This project work focuses on the prevalence of malaria among children 0-5 years in Oredo Local Government Area. This study will cover areas and quarters in Oredo Local Government Area, Benin City, as sample study where resident’s opinion will be sampled.<br/>However, there is delimitation of this study to just 3 area as a result of time constraint and means of transportation.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Children: Plural child.

They are one of the greatest problems facing children today. The diseases are silent killers unlike accident that kills instantly. Man has been trying to get rid of these diseases, for years but efforts made have proved partially abortive. Specifically, pre-school children (0-5 years old) are prone to communicable diseases because of their close interaction with one another, their non-discriminatory behaviours and also their low immunity power. A disease that is transmitted through direct contact with an infected individual or indirectly through a vector. Also called contagious disease.<br/>Communicable Disease Definition <br/>        Communicable disease is often called contagious or infectious disease. Anderson (2000) defined a communicable disease as a disease that can be transmitted from one person to another or from lower animal to higher animal (man). He attributed the cause of these diseases to pathogenic microorganisms. Brain (2007) also noted that communicable disease are infectious diseases that can be passed from person to another or from an animal to a person.<br/>        It is generally believed that nature harbours many microorganism which are very difficult to see with mere naked eyes except with the use of highly powerful microscopic lens. Those microorganisms which harm the human body are called pathogens. Udoh, Fawole, Ajala, Okafo &amp; Nwana (2007) confirmed that pathogens that harm the body are popularly known as germs. These invade the tissues of the human host where they produce the condition called disease. These germs/pathogens (that is virus, bacteria, protozoan and metazoan) are mostly found in dirty places where the temperature and atmosphere support their existence.<br/>        Olaoye (2008) classified communicable diseases into four namely water borne disease, air borne diseases, insect borne and other diseases that are transmitted by contacts and arthropods. Brain (2007) stated that the best way of classifying communicable diseases is by their spread, and these are; air borne or droplet infections; faecal borne or gastro-intestina infections; transmission from animal, from insects and by contacts. Barbara and Bauirer (2007) identified three ways of transmitting communicable diseases as; transmission by contact, by vector and by air.<br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Home environment contribute to communicable diseases among school children. In the Africa culture the value of education is highly perfect, be it formal. If one take the formal education as a case study, the home or environment contribute a lot to the hygienic system of the child both of home and in school. As this could prevent some communicable disease that could have affected the pupils because the sound foundation for future prevention of communicable diseases start from home. lack of care at home, some time cause unhealthy rivalry among pupils as it has a negative effect on the health of the child both of home school and its environment.<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The purpose of this study is to find out the cause and effects of communicable diseases among children in Benin City. specifically, the study sought to:<br/>Determine the causes of communicable disease among children in Benin City.<br/>Ascertain the effect of communicable disease among children in Benin City.<br/>Determine ways to address the issues of communicable disease among children in Benin City.<br/>Determine effect of poverty of parents to the spread of communicable diseases among children.   <br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>The researcher in trying to substantiate the result of his study deducted the following research questions which are:<br/>Does lack of parental care lead to spread of communicable disease among children in Benin City?<br/>Does lack of health education lead to spread of communicable disease among children in Benin City?<br/>Can overcrowding of pupils in classrooms lead to the incidence of communicable disease among children in Benin City?<br/>Does poverty of parents lead to spread of communicable diseases among children?    <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>In carrying out the study, the researcher hoped that it would be of great benefit to the public in general and to the educational system in particular. It would help educate parents on how to handle their environment and the health of their children. This study will help school management in preventing the spread of communicable disease in school and how to help children suffering from such problems. Moreover it is hoped that it would help teachers to know how to handle such children when they experience difficulties.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY/DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY <br/>This study is restricted to pupils from Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State Benin City. it is also limited to some six primary schools within the study area. The researcher limited her study to primary schools in Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>Therefore, only primary six from six primary school located in urban and rural areas of the local government were used for the study. They are as follows:<br/>Abiokula Primary School, Abudu<br/>Adanko Primary School, Evbiboesi<br/>Adenko Primary School, Ugo<br/>Okogbo Primary School, Okogbo<br/>Awannore Primary School, Evboesi<br/>Obozogbe Primary School, Obozogbe <br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Bacteria: Constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from sphere to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacterial inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of earth’s crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationship with plants and animals. They are also known to have flourished in manned spacecraft.  <br/>Communicable: (of a disease) able to be transmitted from one sufferer to another contagious or infectious.<br/>Disease: A disorder of structure or function in a human, animal, or plant, especially one that produces specific symptoms or that affects a specific location and is not simply a direct result of physical injury. A disease is a particular abnormal, pathological condition that affects part or all of an organism. It is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by factors originally from an external source, such as infectious disease, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions, such as autoimmune diseases. In humans, “disease” is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for t hose in contact with the person.<br/>Endemic: in epidemiology, an infections is said to be endemic in a population when that infection is maintained in the population without the need for external inputs. For example, chickenpox is endemic (steady state) in the UK, but malaria is not. Every year, there are a few cases of malaria acquired in the UK, but these do not lead to sustained transmission in the population due to the lack of a suitable vector.<br/>Hazard: A hazard is a situation that poses a level of threat to life, health, property, or environment. Most hazards are dormant or potential, with only a theoretical risk of harm, however, once a hazard becomes “active”, it can create an emergency situation. A hazardous situation that has come to pass is called an incident. Hazard and possibility interact together to create risk.<br/>Sporadic: Appearing or happening at irregular intervals in time, occasional, sporadic renewals of enthusiasms. Appearing in scattered or isolated instances, as a disease, isolated as a single instance of something, being or occurring apart from others occurring singly or widely apart in locality; the sporadic growth of plants.<br/>  <br/> <br/><br/>\n\nTHE EFFECT OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AMONG CHILDREN IN BENIN <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " THE EFFECT OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AMONG CHILDREN IN BENIN ", "id": 24}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>WAYS OF ERADICATING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AMONG PUBLIC PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPILS IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF <br/>EDO STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This project work was designed to find out the communicable diseases among primary school pupils in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area.

The health care delivery system of Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government is being geared towards aligning with the national goal on “health for all”. One way of achieving this goal is through the education of primary school pupils on better health care. This is certainly one of the domains of physical and health education. Health education is designed for primary school level to educate the pupils about common diseases in our immediate environment and their prevention.<br/>        Also health education can also bridge the gap, reduce some of our environmental hazards for the welfare of every citizen. It is well known that children are exposed to various hazards of communicable diseases, it is necessary to guide the children from these diseases. Therefore, the teacher should be very much concerned with the health welfare and survival of his pupils. Communicable diseases in the past have been “endemic” and now it has become “sporadic” because of the awareness of this study. As the name implies communicable disease is derived from the combination of two words, communicable and disease. Communicable is an illness that can be in exchanged, share, transmit or imparted.<br/>        Disease is an unfavourable condition of an organism caused by micro-organisms as a result of illness, disorder of the body or mind. Communicable diseases are sometimes referred to as infectious diseases. They are the diseases which are communicated from one person to another or from animals to man through personal contacts like air, water, dust or the use of personal belonging or families. The communicable diseases that are common in pupils in primary schools include; chicken pox, measles, cholera, whooping cough, typhoid, tuberculosis, craw-craw, poliomyelitis (infant paralysis). The research is intended to carryout the overview of communicable diseases among primary school pupils. It is also intended to give useful advice and suggestions to teachers in primary school in particular on how to prevent the spread of these communicable diseases among the pupils in primary school in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>        This research intends to carryout an overview of communicable diseases among primary school pupils in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area as a case study the researcher intend to do this under the following statement of problems.<br/>Are communicable diseases common among primary pupils in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area?<br/>Do the pupils in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area learn in a dirty environment that will lead to the spread of communicable diseases among them?<br/>Are the pupils and the teachers aware of the prevalence of communicable diseases in the primary school in the local government area?<br/>Does over population in primary schools lead to the spread of communicable diseases among students?<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The purpose of writing this project is as follows;<br/>To identify the communicable diseases that is prevalent in primary schools in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area of Edo State.<br/>To find out the effects of communicable diseases on the pupils and the society at large.<br/>To outline the various causes of the diseases.<br/>To reduce and control the diseases among primary school pupils in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area of Edo State.<br/>To examine the nature and scope of communicable diseases.<br/>SIGNIFICA NCE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The importance of this study cannot be overemphasized.<br/>The study would also be of great help to the ministry of health and the government whose objectives of primary health care are preventive health and gradual eradication of these communicable diseases.<br/>It will help the teachers and the pupils to be aware of the commonest communicable diseases in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government primary schools with the view of preventing their spread.<br/>It helps the teachers to prevent a crowdy classroom in order to give room for ventilation.<br/>It helps the teachers to care about the health of the students and to know how to treat the infected pupil.<br/>It helps in continuous training of teachers on disease control.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>What are the prevalent communicable diseases in the local government area?<br/>How can communicable diseases be controlled?<br/>Do communicable diseases have any effect on primary school children?<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>        The study is exclusively limited to the effects of common communicable diseases on the educational attainment of primary school pupils in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area of Edo State. It is possible to cover all communicable diseases within a short time, consequent upon this, the study is limited to the following diseases; measles, ringworm, and cholera.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>        The following terms were used in this research work, many have different meaning to many people in different fields but for the purpose of this study. The meanings of these terms are as follows.<br/>Communicable diseases: They are the diseases which are passed from one person to another through water, air, dust etc.<br/>Non-communicable diseases: These are diseases that cannot be spread through personal contact, water, dust, air, etc.<br/>Immunity: This is the ability or power possessed by children to resist infection.<br/>Dehydration: This is loss of water and dissolved salt from the body.<br/>Immunization: This is a form of disease prevention involving the injection of a vaccine or an antiserum into the body of an organism in other to protect the organism from attack by a disease.<br/>Vaccination: This is a form of disease prevention involving the administration of antigenic vaccine to stimulate the immune system of an individual to develop adaptive immunity to a disease.<br/>Lumps: This is an infectious disease characterized by the swelling of the neck and the cheek due to the inflammation of the parotid glands at the junction of the neck and the lower jaws.<br/><br/>\n\nWAYS OF ERADICATING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AMONG PUBLIC PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPILS IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF  EDO STATE<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WAYS OF ERADICATING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AMONG PUBLIC PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPILS IN OREDO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF  EDO STATE", "id": 25}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF CHOLERA AMONG CHILDREN IN BENIN CITY<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This research work was designed to examine and analyze the causes and effects of cholera during raining season in Benin City.

The main symptoms are profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting. Transmission is primarily through consuming contaminated drinking water or food. The severity of the diarrhea and vomiting can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Every year there is an estimated 3-5 million cholera cases and 100,000-120,000 deaths due cholera. The short incubation period of two to five days, enhance the potentially explosive pattern of out breaks (Faruque 2008 and WHO 2010). Cholera transmission is closely linked to inadequate environmental management. Typical at-risk areas include peri-urban slums, where basic infrastructure is not available, as well as camps for internally displaced people or refugees, where minimum requirements of clean water and sanitation are not met.  The consequences of a disaster – such as disruption of water and sanitation systems, or the displacement of populations to inadequate and overcrowded camps – can increase the risk of cholera transmission should the bacteria be present or introduced.<br/>Epidemics have never arisen from dead bodies. Cholera remains a global threat to public health and a key indicator of lack of social development. Recently, the reemergence of cholera has been noted in parallel with the ever-increasing size of vulnerable populations living in unsanitary conditions (Emch 2008 and WHO, 2010).<br/>Two serogroups of v. cholera - 01 and 0139 - causes out breaks (Alexander 2008).  v. cholera 01 causes the majority of outbreak, while 0139  -first indentified in Bangladash in 1992 –is confined to South-East Asia. Non-01 and non-0139 v. cholera can cause mild diarrhea but dot not generate epidemics. The bacteria are transmitted via contaminated drinking water or food.  Pathogenic v. cholera can survive refrigeration and freezing in food supplies. (Reildl et al 2002) The dosage of bacteria required to cause an infection in healthily volunteers via oral administration of living vibrios is greater than  1000 organisms (Hartely 2006 ).  After consuming an antacid, however, cholera development in most volunteers after consumption of only  100 cholera  vibrios experiments also show that  vibrios consumed with food are more likely to cause infection than those from water alone (Finkelstein 1996). Cases tend to be clustered by location as well as season, with most infections occurring in children ages 1-5 years (WHO 2010). <br/>      Cholera is severe water-born infectious disease caused by the bacterium  vibrio cholerae.   In 2005, 131,943 cases including 2,272 deaths have notified from 52 countries. The year was marked by a particular significant series of outbreaks in West Africa, which affected 14 countries and accounted for 58% of all cholera cases world-wide (WHO 2006). In the same year Nigeria had 4,477 cases and 174 deaths. There was reported case of cholera in 2008 in Nigeria in which 429 death out of 6,330 cases. More so, 2,304 cases in Niger State in which 114 were reported death in 2008 (NBS 2009). Recent years have seen a strong trend of cholera outbreak in developing countries, including among others, those in India (2007), Iraq (2008), Congo (2008), Zimbabwe (2008-2009), Haiti (2010), Kenya (2010). Koko in Edo State (1989). In Nigeria, according to UN figure, 1,555 people have died since January and 38,173 cases have been reported. The figure is more than four times the death toll the government reported in August (Guardian. 2010)<br/>Cholera is a disease characterized by profuse diarrhea accompanied with a severe dehydration and loss of electrolyte (Colwell and Huq, 1994), caused by toxigenic Vibrio cholerae, a serologically diverse, environmental, and gram-negative rod bacterium (Li et al., 2002). In the absence of appropriate treatment, there is a high mortality rate. Cholera is a major public health concern because of its high transmissibility, death-to-case ratio and ability to occur in epidemic and pandemic forms (Kaper et al., 1995). Cholera is responsible for an estimated death of 120,000 globally every year (WHO, 2001), and still continues to be a scourge worldwide covering all continents. In developing countries with endemic areas, cholera is still very significant with incidence of more than five million cases per year (Tauxe et al., 1994; Lan and Reeves, 2002). The explosive epidemic nature and the severity of the disease and the potential threat to food and water supplies have prompted the listing of V. cholerae as an organism of biological defense research (Zhang et al., 2003). In an epidemic, the great majority of cases can be recognized by clinical diagnosis easily and a bacteriological diagnosis is often not required. Cholera is endemic in Nigeria (Falade and Lawoyin, 1999) and epidemiological features (Utsalo et al., 1991, 1992; Eko et al., 1994; Hutin et al., 2003) have been reported from various parts of the country with investigations on possible sources of outbreaks. Outbreaks of cholera had been reported from various States in Nigeria such as Ogun, Edo, Pleatue State etc, of Nigeria. Investigations on outbreak of cholera in Nigeria have focused on the epidemiological features, the probable source of contamination and the risk factors without spatial linkage of health data. However, advances in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technology provides this opportunity and have become an indispensible tool for processing, analyzing and visualizing spatial data within the domains of environmental health, disease ecology and public health (Kistemann et al., 2002).<br/>The use of GIS is not new in waterborne disease outbreaks and cholera studies. It has been applied in investigating waterborne disease outbreak (NWW, 1999), microbial risk assessment of drinking water reservoirs (Kistemann et al., 2001a), drinking water supply structure (Kistemann et al., 2001b), and spatial patterns of diarrhoea illness with regards to water supply structures (Dangendorf et al., 2002). In cholera studies, GIS technology has been applied in studying the correlation between socio-economic and demographic indices and cholera incidence (Ackers et al., 1998), environmental risk factors (Ali et al., 2002a), spatial epidemiology (Ali et al., 2002b), health risk prediction (Fleming et al., 2007) and spatial and demographic patterns of cholera (Osei and Duker, 2008). This study seeks to assess the causes and effect of cholera outbreak in Benin City, Edo State.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>The threat of cholera rampaging through Nigeria has long been of concern to many. The crowded settings coupled with minimal water, sanitation, hygiene and health services, present a fearsome breeding ground for cholera to quickly escalate beyond control. In an attempt to avoid this worse-case scenario, a massive response needs to be mounted by the Government to enlighten the general public about the causes of this deadly disease and also ways to avoid the outbreak. Hygiene promoters should be employed to work every day, sharing information on how to avoid contracting the illness and the signs and symptoms of the disease.<br/>1.3    PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>The purpose of this study is to determine the causes and effect of cholera during rainy season in Benin City.<br/>The specific objectives of the study are:<br/>1.      To identify the cause of cholera in Benin City.<br/>2.      To ascertain if cholera outbreak is usually rampant during the rainy season among children in Benin City.<br/>3.      To identify the problems associated with the prevention of cholera in Benin City<br/>4.      To determine the ways of preventing cholera outbreak in Benin City.<br/>1.4    RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>The following research questions were asked and answered in the study:<br/>1.      Does poor environmental sanitation lead cholera outbreak?<br/>2.      Can drinking and bathing with contaminated water lead to cholera outbreak?<br/>3.      Does washing of hands before eating help to prevent cholera infection?<br/>4.      Does poorly kept toilet cause cholera outbreak?<br/>5.      Is cholera outbreak rampant during the rainy season?<br/>6.      Does the use of pipe borne water for drinking and cooking help reduce cholera outbreak?<br/>7.      Does boiling of water reduce the risk of cholera infection? <br/>1.5    SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY:<br/>The research work is important in several ways both to the health personnels and the individual within the society. Firstly, this study will expose to us some of the causes of cholera outbreak in Benin City and also proffer ways of preventing cholera outbreak within our community.   <br/>This study is also be relevant to the government by providing the number of cholera outbreak within the Nigeria economy and also present the figures of cholera victims who dies as a result of this disease, by this information, the government can swing into action by providing various measures in other to limit or prevent further outbreak of the disease in our community. <br/>1.6    SCOPE/DELIMITATION OF THE STUDY<br/>The study is set out to determine the causes and effect of cholera outbreak during rainy season in Benin City, Edo State. Therefore, the study is restricted to only community health workers, and other health related personnels in Benin City, Edo State.

Malaria has also been one of the world’s worst killer diseases throughout recorded human history. Despite attempt to eradicate it, it remains one of the worst disease in terms of death annually.<br/>Malaria parasite was discovered in 1886 by Laveran a military physician working in Constantine Algeria (Ksogstad, 1996). Malaria is a serious notificable infectious illness characterized by periodic chills, fever, sweating and sptemomeguly. It has serious and often fatal complications which gave way to Falciparom malaria. It is intermittent and remittent fever caused by a protozoa parasite that incades the red blood cells. Malaria is a preventable and treatable disease of public health. Malaria is by far the most important insect transmitting disease (Curtis, 1991).    <br/>Malaria is a mosquito borne infectious disease of human and other animals causes by protists, it begins with bites from an infected female anopheles mosquito (Churchill, 1998)., it is transmitted in large areas of Africa, South America, Middle East, Eastern Europe etc symptoms of malaria are characterized by cyclic occurrence of chills, fever and profuse sweating. This occur when the merozoite destroys the red blood cells causing toxin to be released into the blood. Its symptoms also includes headache, nausea, aneamia and jaundice if serve.<br/>Malaria is made up of types depending on the plasmodium involves. It includes tertian malaria caused by plasmodium, vivax fever, caused by plasmodium  falciparum. The life cycle of malaria parasite involves the cycle in the blood of man and cycle in mosquito (Obueh, 2003). Considering the magnitude of this problem, it therefore become very extremely important that this project work should be carried out to reduce the prevalence of malaria among children from 0 to 5 years old in Benin City, Benin City, Edo State. <br/>STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM <br/>Malaria has become very common and is increasing in an uncontrolled way throughout Nigeria and world as whole, due to the bite of the female anopheles mosquito which carries the plasmodium in an attempt to eradicate this deadly disease, a massive response need to be mounted by the government to enlighten the public about the prevalence of malaria. Also provide remedy for treatment of it.<br/>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY <br/>The objective of this study is to determine prevalence of malaria among children from 0 to 5 years old in Benin City , Benin City, Edo State. The specific objectives of this study includes;<br/>To determine the prevalence of malaria among children between 0 to 5 years in Benin City , Benin City, Edo State.<br/>To identify the various means the vector transmits the parasite plasmodium.<br/>To determine the symptoms and signs of malaria<br/>To examine the ways to eradicate the prevalence of malaria among children from 0 to 5 years in Benin City , Benin City, Edo State.     <br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>The following research questions were asked and answered in the process of study of this work;<br/>Does lack of awareness contribute to the prevalence of malaria among children in Benin City ?<br/>Does poverty encourage the spread of malaria among residents of Benin City ?<br/>Can malaria lead to the death of children from 0 to 5 years old in Benin City ?<br/>Can poor sanitation among the residents lead to prevalence of malaria in Benin City ?<br/>Does the use of insecticides treated net prevent the prevalence of malaria among children in Benin City ?<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This research work is very relevant in several ways to communities, personnel, individual, and government.<br/>The work will expose the prevalence of malaria and enlighten the community on t he effects of malaria among children in Benin City mostly in Benin City . Also it will proper measures for preventing this deadly disease. This study will also enlighten people on the signs and symptoms of malaria and how the parasite plasmodium invade the host body through the transmission by the vector mosquito.<br/>The study will encourage the government of Edo State to swing into actions by creating various measures to prevent further outbreaks of malaria among the resident of the states.   <br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>This project work focuses on the prevalence of malaria among children 0-5 years in Benin City . This study will cover areas and quarters in Benin City , Benin City, as sample study where resident’s opinion will be sampled.<br/>However, there is delimitation of this study to just 3 area as a result of time constraint and means of transportation.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>Children: Plural child.

A. because the plants were exposed to the same climate environ local  varieties plant and local propagation of cherry fruit without the use of adequate (little or no) fertiliz4er and new hybrid of cherry species.<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>BACKGROUND TO THE STUDY <br/>Cherry Plant: (Prunmus spp) – Cherry is a fleshy drupe (stone) fruit of plants from the genus “Prunus” members of the family “Rosaecea”. This species in the rose family has a diploid set of sixteen chromosomes (2n=16). The fruit is a drupe which measures 1-2cm (0.4-0.8in) in diameter. (larger in some cultivated regions/sections). It is pale yellow in colour when mature in the mid-summer; it is edible and variably sweet to eat. However, all parts of the fruit except for the ripe fruit are slightly toxic in nature containing an acid called “CYANOGENIC  GLYCOSIDES”. Each fruit contain a single hard-shelled stone 8-12mm long, 7-10mm wide and 6-8mm thick grooved along the flattest edge. The seed (kernel) inside the stone is 6-8mm long. The fruit is readily eaten by numerous kinds of birds and mammals which digest the fruity flesh and disperse the seeds in their droppings. Some rodent and a fero birds notably the “HAWFINCH” also crack open the seeds to eat the kernel inside. There are two major varieties of cherries namely;<br/>The sweet cherry – (Prumus avium)<br/>The sour cherry – (prunus cerasus)<br/>They are distinguished just as the names suggest. That is by their distinctive tastes. Both varieties of cherry tree can be grown from seeds (otherwise known as cherry pits). The trees grow to be between 8 and 30ft tall depending on whether they are dwarf, semi-dwarf or full sized. The wild cherries have been part of the human diet for a very long time. Some eighteen and nineteenth centuries ago, botanical authors assumed a western Asia origin for the species based on the writings of a botanist called PLINY. However archeological findings of seeds from pre-historic Europe contradict this view. The stones have been found in deposits at Bronze Age settlements throughout Europe including Britain. However, in one dated example, wild cherry micro-fossils were found in a core sample from the “defruits” beneath a dwelling at an early and middle bronze age pile dwelling site and in the shore of a former lake at “desenzano del garda or lonato, near the northern shore of lake garda Italy. The date is estimated at early bronze age 1A carbon-dated then to 2077BC plus or mims 10 years. The natural forest was largely cleared at that time. By 800BC cherries were being actively cultivated in Asia minor and soon after in Greece as the main ancestor of the cultivated cherry.            <br/>YIELD OF PLANT <br/>Crop yield can be defined as a measurement of the amount of a crop that was harvested per unit of land area. crop yield is the measurement often used for a cereal, grain or legume and its normally measured in metric tons per hectare (or kilogrammes per hectare).<br/>Crop yield can also refer to the actual seed generation from the plant for example, a  grain or wheat yielding three new grains of wheat would have a crop yield of 1:3. It is also referred to as “agricultural output”. <br/>Dictionary speaking, yield  has two meanings that seem quite different. “an amount” or “to give way”. The yield of the recipe was twelve brownie to avoid being tripped, Mary was forced to yield to the children on her way to the brownie plate. While these meanings seem quite different, they both mean “to give”. Yield can also be defined as to give forth or produce by a natural process or in return for cultivation.      <br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM <br/>Is cherry fruit important species in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area?<br/>Do we have high yield of cherry fruit in Ikpoba Okha Local Government?<br/>Is the environment in Ikpoba Okha condiucive for cherry plant?<br/>Component of yield of cherry plant is it the same in the different market in Ikpoba Okha LGA?<br/>PURPOSE OF  STUDY <br/>Purpose of the study is to carry out a market survey in three different markets in Ikpoba Okha and compare the component of yield of cherry fruit. Circumference, number of seeds, weight in the market).<br/>The research is also to find out the view of people in Ikpoba Okha L. G. A. about the yield of cherry plant and how to improve the yield.   <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>This project work is designed especially to provide people particularly those in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of Edo State with the prospect of the cherry fruit as it affect the socio-economic life of the people in Ikpoba Okha.<br/>The project also aim to improve the yield of pepper plant in their environment and to draw the attention of the government in Ikpoba Okha to improve the lives of the people. <br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>In order to ensure a comprehensive investigation of this study it is important to formulate a number of questions to guide in collection of data that will facilitate the arrangement of finding and to make worthy discussion of finding.

There are many “familiar” of phytochemicals and they help the human body in a variety of ways. Phytochemicals may protect human from a host of disease. They are non-nutritive plant chemicals that have protective or disease preventive properties, plant produce these chemicals to protect itself but recent research demonstrates that many phytochemicals can protect humans against diseases. There are many phytochemicals in fruits and herbs and each works differently. The coconut, cocos nucifera L, has been described as the “tree of life” or tree of heaven and nature’s greatest gift to man. Each part of the coconut tree can be used to produce items of value for the community. Cocos nucifera L is a dominant type of tree belonging to the family Arecaceae (palm). The common name of cocos nucifera is coconut or coconut palm. Coconut is believed to have its origins in the Ido-Malayan region from where its spread throughout to tropics. The coconut palm is monoecious, i.e. with male and female flowers on the same inflorescence, called a spadix, that develops within a woody sheathe or spathe. At flowering, the spathe splits length wise to expose the spadix. Each spadix consists of a man axis 1-1.5m (3-3-5ft) in length with 40-60 branches or spikelets bearing the flowers linder favorable growing conditions first flowering occurs about 4-5 years after planting.<br/>        Once a palm reaches maturity, a spadix (flower spike) is produced in every leaf axil between 12 and 15 spadices are produced throughout the year at fairly regular intervals, although drought conditions can delay the emergence of the spadix or cause it to abort, the number of female flowers per spadix varies. Since the floral primordial are initiated 12 months before the spadix emerges, the number is correlated to the growing conditions (weather, nutrition) 12 months prior to emergence from the literature survey, it is quite evident that the nflowers of cocos nucifera has potent therapentic value on the area of anti bacterial, larvicidal, antioxidant, dietary anti inflammatory, hepatoprotective and anti cancer. The present investigation aims to focus on the identification of some useful phytochemicals constituents cocos nucifera water extract.<br/> 1.2 COCOS NUCIFERA<br/>          The coconut tree (cocos nucifera) is a member of the family Arecaceae (palm family). It is the only accepted species in the genus cocos. The term coconut can refer to the entire cocnut palm, the seed or the fruit, which botanically is a drupe, not a nut. The spelling coconut is an archaic form of the word. The term is derived from the 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish word coco meaning “head” or “skull” from the three indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features.<br/>        The coconut is known for its great versatility as seen in the many uses of its different parts and found throughout the tropics and subtropics. Coconuts are the part of the daily diets of many people coconut is different from any other fruits because they contain a large quantity of “water” and when immature they are known as tender-nuts or jelly-nuts and may be harvested for drinking. When mature, they still contain some water and can be used as seed-nuts or processed to give oil from the kernel, char coal from the hard shell and coir from the fibrous husk. The endosperm is initially in its nuclear phase suspended within the coconut water. As development continues, cellular layers of endosperm deposit along the walls of the coconut, becoming the edible coconut “flesh” when dried, the coconut flesh is called copra. The oil and milk derived from it are commonly used in cooking and frying, coconut oil is also widely used in cooking and cosmetic. The clear liquid coconut water within is potable. The husks and leaves can be used as materials to make a variety of products for furnishing and decorating, it also has cultural and religious significance in many societies that use it.<br/>DESCRIPTION<br/>          Plant Cocos nucifera is a large palm, growing up to 30m (98ft) tall, with pinnate leaves 4-6m (13-20ft) long and pinnae 60-90 long old leaves break away cleanly, leaving the trunk smooth. Coconutsm are generally classified into two general types, tall and dwarf. On very fertile land, a tall coconut palm tree can yield up to 75 fruits per year, but more often yields less than 30, mainly due to poor cultural practices. Given proper care and growing conditions coconut palms produce the first fruits in six to ten years, it takes 15-230 years to reach peak production.<br/>        Fruits botanically, the coconut fruits is a drupe not a true nut like other fruits, it has three layers the exocarp, mesocard and endocarp. The exocarp and mesocarp make up the “husk” of the coconut. Coconuts sold in the shops of nontropical countries often have had the exocarp (outermost layer) removed. The mesocarp is composed of a fiber, called coir, which has many traditional and commercial uses. The shell has three germination pores (stoma) or “eyes” that are clearly visible on its outside surface once the husk is removed.<br/>        A full size coconut weighs about 1.44kg (3-216). It takes around 6,000 full grown coconuts to produce a tone of corpa. <br/>        Roots unlike some other plants, the palm tree have neither a tap root nor root hairs, but have fibrous root system.<br/>        The coconut palm root system consists of an abundance of thin rooks that grow outward from the plant near the surface. Only a few of the root penetrate deep into the soil for stability. The type of root system is known as fibrous or adventitious and is a characteristic of grass species. Other types of large trees produce a single downward-growing tap root with a number of feeder roots growing from it.<br/>        Coconut palms continue to produce roots from the base of the stem throughout its life. The number of roots produced depends on the age of the tree and the environment, with more than 3,600 roots possible on a tree that is 60 to 70 years old. Roots are uniformly thick from the tree trunk to the root tip.<br/>        Inflorescence: The palm produces both the female and male flowers on the same inflorescence; thus the palm is monoecious. Other sources use the term polygamomonoecious. The female flower is much larger than the male flower. Flowering occurs continuously. Coconut palms are believed to be largely cross pollinated, although some dwarf varieties are self-pollinating.<br/>Taxonomy<br/>Cellular organisms Eukaryote-Viridiplantae<br/>Streptophyta –Streptophyta-Euphyllophyta<br/>Spermatophyte-Tracheophyta-liliopsida<br/>Commelinids – Arecales-Arecaceae<br/>Arecoideae – Cocoseae- Attaleinae-cocos-Cocos nucifera<br/>CLASSIFICATION<br/>Kingdom            Plantae<br/>Division              Magnoliophyta<br/>Class                         Liliopsida<br/>Family               Arecaceae<br/>Genus                Cocos<br/>Species              C. nucifera<br/>CULTIVATION<br/>        V palms are grown in more than 90 countries of the world, with a total production of 62 millions tones per years. Most of the world production is in tropical Asia. Coconut trees are very hard to establish in dry climates, and cannot grow there without frequent irrigation, in drought conditions, the new leaves do not open well, and older leaves may become desiccated, fruits also tends to be shed.<br/>Technical Requirement of Coconut Cultivation<br/>Agro-climate requirements<br/>        Coconut is essentially a tropic plant but has been found to grow under varying agro climatic conditions. The mean annual temperature for optimum growth and maximum yield is stated to be 270c with a diurnal variation of 60c to 70c and relative humidity more than 60%. The coconut palm thrives well up to an altitude of 600m above MSL. The coconut palm thrives well under an evenly distributed annual rainfall ranging from 100mm to 3000mm. However, a well distributed rainfall of about 2000mm is the ideal rainfall for proper growth and higher yield.<br/> <br/>Soil                        <br/>        The coconut palm can tolerate wide range of soil conditions. But the palm does show certain growth preferences. A variety of factors such as drainage, soil depth, soil fertility and layout of the land has great influence on the growth of the palm. The major soil types that support coconut in India are laterite, alluvialred sandy loan, coastal sandy and reclaimed soils with a pH ranging from 5.2 to 8.0.<br/>Selection of site<br/>        Soil with a minimum depth of 12m and fairly good water holding capacity is preferred for coconut cultivation. Shallow soils with underlying hard rock, low lying areas subjected to water stagnation and clayey soils should be avoided. Proper supply of moisture either through well distributed rainfall or irrigation and sufficient drainage are essential for coconut.<br/>Preparation of land<br/>        Size of the pit depends on the soil type and water table. In laterite soils large pits of the size 1.2m x 1.2m x 1.2 may be dug and filled up with loose soil, powered cow dung and ash up to a depth of 60cm before planting. In loaming soils, pits of size 1m x 1m x 1m filled with top soil to height of 50cm is recommended, while filling the pits, two layers of coconut husk can be arrange at the bottom of the pit with concave surface fusing upwards for moisture conservation. After arranging each layer, BHC 10%/DP should be sprinkled on the husk to prevent termite attack. In laterite soils, common salt at 2kg pit may be applied, six months, prior, on the floor of the pit to soften the hard pans.<br/>Spacing<br/>        In general square system of planting with a spacing of 7.5m x 7.5m is recommended for coconut. This will accommodate 177 palms per hectare. However, spacing of 7.5 to 10m is practiced in various coconut growing regions of the country.<br/>Harvesting<br/>        Coconuts are harvested at varying intervals in a year. The frequency differs in different areas depending upon the yield of the trees in well maintained and high yielding gardens, bunches are produced regularly and harvesting is done once a month. Coconut becomes mature in about 12months after the opening of the spathe. It is the ripe coconut which is the source of major coconut products nut which are eleven months old give fibre of good quality and can be harvested in the tracts where green husks are required for the manufacture of coir fibre. Economic life of the coconut palm is about 60 years.<br/>1.3 TRADITIONAL USES OF COCONUT<br/>        The coconut is used for roofing and side screens on traditional housing and woven coconut leaves are used to carry or serve food. The timber is used for housing and canoe building. While the coconut shells have been used for centuries to carry water or store coconut oil. The fresh sap is boiled to use as a natural sweetener or mixed with water to make a lovely sweet drink. Coconut trunks are used for building small bridges and huts, they are preferred for their straightness, strength, and salt resistance. Coconut trunks are used for house construction. Coconut timber comes from the trunk, and is increasingly being used as an ecologically sound substitute for endangered hardwoods. It has applications in furniture and specialized construction, as notably demonstrated in Manila’s coconut palace. The coconut husk is used as a potting medium to produce healthy forest tree sapling, coconuts are used in the beauty industry in moisturizers to its chemical structures, is readily absorbed by the skin. The coconut shell may also be ground down and added to products for exfoliation of dead skin. Coconut is also a source of lauric acid, which can be processed in a particular way to produce sodium lauryl sulfate, a detergent used in showers gels and shampoos. Half coconut shells are used in theatre foley sound effects of a horses hoof beats. Dried half shells are used as the bodies of musical instruments, coconut meals used as livestock feed. The dried calyx is used as fuel in wood fired stoves. Coconut water is traditionally used as a growth supplement in plant tissue culture/micro propagation.<br/>1.4 MEDICINAL USES OF COCONUT<br/>        Coconut is used to treat a wide variety of health problems including the following Abscesses, asthma, baldness, bronchitis, bruises, burns colds, constipation, cough, dropsy, dysentery, earache, fever, flu, gingivitis, gonorrhea, irregular or painful menstruation, jaundice, kidney stones, malnutrition, nausea, rash, scabies, scurvy, skin infection, sore throat, swelling, syphilis toothache, tuberculosis, tumors, typhoid ulcers, upset stomach, weakness and wounds. Coconut water is known as a tasty beverage popular mainly in tropic Island, however far not all of us are aware of health benefits of coconut water. Generally speaking, it contains a whole amount of supplements that are needed in order to supplements that are needed in order to sustain life.<br/>Potassium- it helps to lower arterial blood pressure.<br/>Glucose- It acts as sugar needed for body energy.<br/>Vitamin C- It shields the body for ailments like scurvy.<br/>Vitamin B- It helps to replace worn out tissues and cells.<br/>Hair care <br/>          Coconut oil is one of the best natural nutrition for hair. It helps in healthy growth of hair providing them a shiny complexion; it is effective in reducing the protein loss for damage and undamaged hair.<br/>Immunity<br/>        Coconut oil is also good for the immune system, it strengthen the immune system as it contains antimicrobial lipids, lauric acid, capric acid and caprylic acid which have antifungal, antibacterial and antiviral properties. The human body converts lauric acid into monolaurin which is claimed to help in dealing with viruses and bacteria causing diseases such as herpes, influenza, cytomegalovirus, and even HIV. It helps in fighting harmful bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes and heliobacterpylori, and harmful protozoa such as giardia lamblia.<br/> Weight loss<br/>        Coconut oil is very useful in benefits of honey in weight loss, it contains short and medium chain fattyacide that helps in taking off excessive weight it is also easy to digest and it helps in healthy functioning of the thyroid and enzymes systems. Further, it increases the body metabolism by removing stress on pancreases, thereby burning out more energy and helping obese and overweight people reduce their weight. Hence, people living in tropic coastal areas, who eat coconut oil daily as their primary cooking oil, are normally not fat, obese or overweight.   <br/>1.5 ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF COCONUT<br/>        The coconut palm provides a substantial export income for many tropical countries, as well as food and drink for home consumption and fuel and shelter of the exported products, copra, the dried kernel, is a major source of vegetable oil and coconut oil, and shielded and dried kernel is widely used in the bakery and confectionery trades as desiccated coconut. Copra cake, left after oil extraction, is a valued animal feed, especially for dairy cattle.   <br/>          The leading coconut producer nations are (in order) the Philippians, Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Malaysia, while production from nations such as Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu is relatively small, the coconut trade is a major source of export revenue for these countries, in some years, copra comprises more than 50% of Vanuatu exports income.<br/>        The coconut industry is the highest net foreign exchange earner of agricultural exports in the Philippines, accounting for about 1.5% of GNP. It employs directly or indirectly, some 20 million people (about one-third of the population) and earns more than US$510m annually. However, the industry’s ability to meet demand and expanding may be jeopardized by:<br/>The declining share of coconut oil in the world’s oil and fat market.<br/>A proposed levy on vegetable oil imports to the European community and a campaign against coconut oil in US.<br/>More stringent aflatoxin regulations imposed in the international copra market.<br/>Erosion of the European desiccated coconut market.<br/>Lack of a market development and expansion program; and.<br/>Low incomes for coconut to respond to changing patterns in world trade in coconut products could have adverse effects on employment and revenue.<br/>1.6 EXTRACTION <br/>        The shade-dried flowers of cocos nucifera were extracted with various solvents. Shloroform, methanol, ethanol, hydroaclcohol )80% aqueous ethanol) and aqueous extracts of flowers of cocos nuficera were prepared in 20g/200ml. the excess solvent in the extract were removed by distillation and concentrated on water bath, the extracts were then collected in petridish and stored in desicators at room temperature. The extracts were used for the detection of phytochemical analysis.<br/>Type<br/>          While to the consumers it may seem that there are a few different types of coconuts, there is really only one species of coconut plant. The coconut palm, cocos nucifera, is the only type of palm tree that produces coconut. Within this species, however, there are dozens of different varieties of coconuts the different varieties are usually divided into two main types, tall and dwarf.<br/>        Tall are the most common type of coconut palm they can cross-pollinate, which means that they share genetic materials among trees, leading to a lot of variation in the characteristics of the fruit the two main types of tall coconut are the Niu Kafa which grows mostly in the wild and not commercially and the Niu Vai, which is domesticated. In most cases, the many different types of coconut that fall between the two types are named according to where they are grown some varieties include the West Africa Tall and the Tampakan Taqll.<br/>        Dwarf coconut mostly self-pollinate, which means that there are fewer different types. As the name indicates, they are smaller than then tall, which makes them more popular to grow in home gardens and parts. Dwarf coconut trees produce more fruit than tall size do, but the coconut are generally smaller in size like tall trees, dwarfs are usually named by their country of origin, in addition, the color of then young fruits is included as part of the name. Some varieties include the Cameroon Red, the Malayan Yellow, and the Nias Green.<br/>        One variety of coconut, the Niu Leka Dwarf, also known as the Fiji Dwarf or Samoan Dwarf, is distinct from other dwarf varieties, this several characteristics in common with the tall.<br/> 1.7 BIOACTIVE CONSTITUENTS IN MEDICINAL PLANTS<br/>        Mayer’s Test: A small quantity of the extract was treated with few drops of dilute hydrochloric acid and filtered. The filtrate was filling with Alkaloid Mayer’s reagent. Formation of cream precipitate indicated the presence of alkaloids. Wagner’s Test: To 2-3ml extract with few drops Wagner’s reagent formation of reddish brown precipitate indicates the presence of alkaloids.<br/>1.7.2 Saponins<br/>          Foam Test: the extract was diluted with 20ml of distill water and it was shaken with a graduated cylinder for 15minutes. Alayer of foam indicated the presence of Saponnis.<br/>1.7.3 Flavoniods<br/>        Naoh Tests: To 2-3ml of extract drops of sodium hydroxide solution were added in a test tube formation of intense yellow colour that became colourless on addition of few drops of dilute HCL indicated the presence of flavoniods.<br/>1.7.4 Glycosides <br/>        Akyl Glycosides have been described in hetero in cyanobacteria where they likel6y take part in the protection of these cells. They were isolated and studied in nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria such as anabaena cylindrical (Nicholas BW et al, nature 1968, 217, 767) and several forms were structurally characterized.<br/>        Other forms with different chain length and functionally groups on the chain have been studied in other species (cyanospira rippkae, anamaeba torulosa). Their structures consist of sugar moitiess glycosidically bound to long-chain diols, triols, keto-ols and keto-diols. The aglycome moiety consisted of C26 or C28 carbon-chains with hydroxyl functionalities likely at the C-3 position.<br/>        Alkyl glucosides found in Nostacaceae were characterized by the presence of troils and of C-3 Ketones. Ascarosides are a group of simple glycolipids which were described are in eggs and tissues of nematodes (Ascaridiodea) (Fougeuy C et al, Bull Soc Biol 1957, 39, 101). Investigations on the chemical nature of ascarosides from Parascaris equorum and Ascaris Suum (Bartley PJ et al) Nat prod 1996, 59, 921) have shown that they are formed basically by a glycosyl moiety (3,6 didesoxymannose, known as ascarylose) linked to a z-hydroxylated hydrocarbon containing  26 and 33 carbon atoms.<br/>1.7.5 Phonolics<br/>        Phenol Test: When 0.5ml of fecl3 (W/V) solutions was added to 2ml of test solutions, formation of an intense colour indicated the presence of phenols.<br/>1.7.6 Tannins<br/>          Ferric Chlodride Test: Small quantity of extract was boiled in 20ml of water in a test tube and then filtered. A few drop of 0.1% ferric chloride was added and observed for brownish green or blue-black coloration which indicate the presence of tannis.<br/>1.7.7 Steriods<br/>        Salkowski Test: To 2ml of extract, add 2ml chloroform and 2ml concentrated H2S054 and was shaken well chloroform layer appeared red and acid layer showed greenish yellow fluorescence indicated the presence of steriols.<br/>        Liberman-Burchard’s Test: Mix 2ml extract with chloroform acid, 1-2ml acetic anhydride and 2 drops concentrated H2S054 from the side of the test tube. First red, then blue and finally green colour indicated the presence of sterols.<br/>        Bioactive constituents which have been reported include stigmastane type saponnins (vernoniosides) steroidal saponins, sesquiterpene lactones vernomygdin, hydroxy vernolide), phenolics acids lignans, xanthones, anthraquinanes, terpenese, coumarins and peptides edoties). Nutrient composition of coconut water are vitamins, glucose, potassium minerals, electrolytes, enzymes, amino acids, cytokine, and phyto-hormones.<br/>1.7.8 Eugenols<br/>             Eugenol is a phenypropene, on allyl chain-substituted guaiacol. Eugenol is a member of the phenylpropaniods class of chemical compounds, it is a colourless to pale yellow oily liquid extracted from certain essential oils especially from clove oil, nutmeg, cinnamon, basil and bay leaf. It is present in concentrations of 80-90% in clove bud oil and at 82-88% in clove leaf oil.<br/>Modern Uses of Eugenol<br/>        Eugenol is used in perfumeries, flavorings, essential oils and in medicine as a local antiseptic and anesthetic. Eugenol can be combine with zinc oxide to form a materials known as zinc oxide engonel which has restorative and prosthodontic applications in dentistry for example, zinc oxide eugenol is used for root canal sealing it can be used to reduce the presence of listeria monocytogenes and lactobacillus sakei in food. Thet are also used in manufacturing stabilizer and antioxidants for plastics and rubbers. Attempts have been made to develop eugenol derivatives for intravenous injection, such as propanidid and G.29.505. the latter produced unacceptable side effects around the site of injection in many patients it is one of many compound that is attractive to makes of various species of orchid bees, which apparently gather the chemical to synthesize pheromones, it is commonly used as bait to attract and collect these bees for study. It also attract male cucumber beetle it is recently discovered that eugenol and isoeugenol, flora volatile scent compound, are catalyzed by single type of enzyme in gymnadenia species and gene encoding for this enzyme is first functionally characterized gene in this species so far.<br/>        It is commonly used in wisdom tooth extraction surgeries complicated by dry socket. Clove oil is growing in popularity as an anesthetic for use on aquarium fish as well as a wild fish when sampled for research and management purposes. Where readily available, it presents a humane method to euthanize sick and diseased fish either by direct over dose or to induce sleep before and overdose of ethanol; it is used in some mousetraps and skills certain human colon cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Eugenol may have potential therapeutic effects against diseases characterized by excessive osterclast activity.<br/>TOXICITY OF EUGENOL <br/>          Eugenol is hepatotouix, meaning it may cause damage to the liver. Overdose is possible, causing a wide range of symptoms from blood in the patient’s urine to convulsions, diarrhea, nausea, unconsciousness, dizziness or rapid heartbeat. According to a published 1993 report, a 2 year old boy nearly died after taking between 5 and 10ml eugenol is subject to restrictions on its use in perfumery as some people may become sensitized to it, however, the degree to which eugenol can cause an allergic reaction in humans is disputed.<br/>ALLERGY OF EUGENOL <br/>        Eugenol is a component of Balsam of Peru to which some people are allergic. When eugenol is used in dental preparations such as surgical pastes, dental packing, and dental cement, it may cause contact stomatitis and allergic cheilitis. The allergy can be discovered via patch test.<br/>1.7.9 Terpenes<br/>        Terpene, any of a class of hydrocarbons occurring widely in plants and animals and empirically regarded as built up from isoprene a hydrocarbon consisting of five carbon atoms, (C5 H8). The term is often extended to the terpeniods, which are oxygenated derivatives of these hydrocarbons.<br/>        Biological formation of the terpenes occurs by the combination of two molecules of acetic acid to give mevalonic acid (C6 H12 04) and conversion of the latter to isopentenyl pyrophosphate, which contains the  five carbon isoprene skeleton.  Further transformation of the isopentenyl compound yield the true terpenes and the terpenoids.<br/>        The true terpenes are usually grouped according to the number of isoprene (C5 H8) units in the molecule: monoterpenes (C10 H16) contains two such units; sesquisterpenes (C15 H24), three; diterpenes (C20 H32), four; triterpenes (C30 H48), six; and tetraterpenes (C40 H64), eight. Rubber and gutta-percha are polyterpenes in which 1,000-5,000 isoprene units are joined in a long chain. Monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes are abundant in essential oils of plants: turpentine containe contains several monoterpenes. Vitamin A is another important diterpene. The triterpene  squalene obtainable from shark-liver oil, may be converted to cholesterol and many other steroids. The carotenoid pigments are the best known tetraterpenes.<br/>1.10 AIM<br/>        The aim of this work is to identify the phytochemicals present in cocos nucifera water extract.<br/>1.11 Specific Objective <br/>        The specific objectives are to carry out phytochemical analysis on coconut water and also:<br/>Collecting drying and pulverisationof coconut water.<br/>Extraction of coconut water using distilled water by maceration method.<br/>Determination of phytochemicals present in extract of the plant.<br/><br/>\n\nPHYTOCHEMICAL SCREENING OF COCONUT WATER EXTRACT   <div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " PHYTOCHEMICAL SCREENING OF COCONUT WATER EXTRACT   ", "id": 29}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>USES OF COCONUT PALM PRODUCTION: A CASE STUDY OF AGBAZILO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Agbazilo Local Government Area which is made up of many villages and towns have their headquarters at Ubiaja. This area is rich in coconut palm (cocos nucifera) this project therefore, reveals some of the economic uses of coconut palm products and how they can be made locally or industrially. In the work, it could be seen how coconut could be used for preparing some useful products. These products include, coconut candy, coconut cake, coconut palm sugar, brooms, mats, nets, brushes, woven bags, upholstery works and some other products that are very useful to mankind and the society. All these products are so useful to individuals and its brings income to the society.   <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>Introduction<br/>General origin<br/>Maintenance of coconut palm<br/>Uses of coconut palm products<br/>Purpose of study<br/>Limitations of the study<br/>Scope of the study<br/>Significance of the study<br/>Statement of the problem<br/>CHAPTER TWO <br/>Literature Review<br/>A brief summary of chapter two<br/>CHAPTER THREE        <br/>Method/materials<br/>Coconut candy, Coconut cake<br/>Coir or fibre utilization in Agbazilo<br/>Natural retting<br/>Minor products of food value<br/>Coconut palm sugar<br/>Sap collection and processing of coconut palm sugar<br/>Broom preparation<br/>Coconut shell utilization<br/>CHAPTER FOUR <br/>Result/observation<br/>Analysis of coconut candy<br/>Processing trials of coconuts palm sugar<br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Conclusion<br/>Problems/limitations of study<br/>Recommendations<br/>REFERENCES      <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUTION<br/>Coconut which have its botanical name as cocosnucifera is used by every country all over the world but this project work is all about the local and industrial ways of using coconut palm products in Bendel state especially Agbazilo local government area. The people of Agbazilo local government area have fertile land for agricultural practice, though they use crude implements mostly, their main occupation is farming and hunting. Due to recent development in skills, the people of agbazilo have improved on the uses of these products; some parts can now be modernized. The coir fibre of interior quality obtained by partial retting in husks and subsequent mechanical decortication are used for stuffing mathresses, crushions and upholstery <br/>In fact, the year 1976 is regarded as a ‘golden ‘year in Agbazilo. The local government council opened a training institute for the blind at Ubiaja. The aim of this was to train the blind (who were formally idle) how to make good use of coconut fibres (modernizing).<br/>GENERAL ORIGIN    <br/>For centuries now, there have been controversy among botanist over the origin of coconut. Until this moment, it has not been settled, this due to its mass cultivation and methods of dispersal.<br/>Three different theories have propounded on the origin of coconut palm. The first theory suggested the northern end of ‘andes’ as the probable place of origin from where the dispersal might have been effected by the pre-historic explorers into the pacific. The same theory also rely on the fact that coconut came from America and this made them very popular among neighboring countries.<br/>The second theory is in Favour of assigning its original habitat to the coasts of Central America from where the nuts might have been carried over by the equatorial ocean currents to pacific islands.<br/>The third theory presumes its place of origin to be some where in South Asia or Malaysia or in the pacific from where the coconut might have accidentally reached coasts of America.<br/> The above theories has its own merits and demerits, it is now widely accepted that the coconut palm might have originated, from America but some where in the old world tropics. However, in the absence of clinching evidence, it has not yet been possible to pinpoint the original habitat of the palm in the world tropics.<br/>MAINTENANCE OF COCONUT PALM <br/>It is most necessary to care for coconut palm from the time of planting to the third or fourth year that the palm can be made to bear early and well. Despite that, the seedlings should be protected from stray cattle till they attention sufficient height. This is done by financing individual’s plants or the entire garden. During the first year of planting, care should be taken to see that water as often as possible. During summer, the seedlings should be shaded properly. Shading reduces qualities and the frequency of watering. Termites, Rhinoceros beetle and the leaf eating caterpillar are the common pests found to affect mostly the young palms. The seedling should be inspected frequently and prompt control measures taken if affected by any of the above pests. Prophylactic sprayings with suitable copper fungicides should also be given against short rot and but rot diseases.<br/>USES OF COCONUT PALM PRODUCTS  <br/>        According to Burcill in 1966, he described coconut palm as one of the natures greatest gift to man. Another great botanist, Mr. Corner in the same year says that coconut palm products displays the whole range of human dependence on palm products. Coconut provides food, drinks, oil, medicine, fibres; timbers thatch mats, fuel and domestic utensils.<br/>        In Agbazilo, the manufactured coconut oil called udeagbon. This is mostly done by the women. This oil can be used for cooking, ointment, illumination, lubrication, soap making and cakes. The coir is the most important product that can be obtained by decertification of the husk. It is an industrial hard fibre. Ligin is the main constituent responsible for the stiffness of the coir. The bristile fibre is used in the manufacture of brushes and brooms. For commercial purposes, the yarn is used to make ropes, mats matting, nets and bags. The ability of coir yarn and rope to withstand the prolonged action of sea water makes them specially suitable for use on boat and ships.<br/>        The young fruit and matured ones are used for sacrifice to their godless known by them as (olokun). No wonder Mr. Corner describes the uses of legion. It is not surprising that it is called the tree of life, heaven and mankind greatest provider in the tropics. Coconut palm is very much cared for by the Agbazilos. To them, non of the parts is useless. And they cultivate them in a wide range for the benefit of the whole country mostly our Bendel State. More analysis of coconut products mentioned above shall be seen in other chapters.<br/>PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>        This project is to show the importance and the uses of coconut palm products and suggests the ways in which, the locally manufactured ones can be improved on. As a result, the government should set up industries for processing coconut products in Bendel State. I believed that this will help to improve the states economic revenue.<br/>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY <br/>        In writing this project work, some problems were encountered of which they are:<br/>Transport problems: Most of the information were collected from the Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR). Transportation is a big problem because, it is sometimes difficult to get a direct road from Oluku to Nifor.<br/>Collection of textbooks: Collecting textbooks for the literature review was also difficult because there is no textbook which is mainly on coconut palm in the College Library. Textbooks were also collected from the Nifor Library etc.<br/>Recommendation: From discussion with the director of Nifor and with some villages like Ebelle, Ewohimi etc I got some information’s for this research work.<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>        The government should create an opportunity for young people that is coming to this field by giving them good instrument and good tools in other for it to bring out the best in the production of palm products. I believe that, if this is done, it will help to improve the states economic revenue.<br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  <br/>        During this research work, I noticed palm products are very important to the economy. Without this palm product, it will be very difficult to get palm oil for cooking and brooms of which this is useful in cleaning the environment.<br/>        There are many product that can be gotten from palm and without this palms this product cannot be seen or used.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/>        In writing this project work, some problems were encountered of which with this problem, the production of palm products cannot be carried out. These problems are:<br/>Lack of inadequate facilities for working.<br/>Lack of good information can lead to a very big problem on the plantation of coconut palm products.<br/>Without good foundation, it will be so difficult to get good palms.<br/>Without good research, it will be difficult to get good information about the plantation of coconut palms<br/>It is good to have a knowledge on the plantation of palm products before going into this field because it can lead to the effect from time to time.<br/> <br/><br/>\n\nUSES OF COCONUT PALM PRODUCTION: A CASE STUDY OF AGBAZILO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " USES OF COCONUT PALM PRODUCTION: A CASE STUDY OF AGBAZILO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA", "id": 30}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>REPRODUCTION IN MAMMALS USING MAN  AS A CASE STUDY IN UHUNMWONDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF EDO STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This study examined reproduction in mammals using man as a case study. In the study, some of the main features of reproduction in man are explored. After considering some of the various aspects of reproduction in man and the challenges faced, we move to consider in particular, pregnancy and childbirth. To this effect, a questionnaire was designed that addressed issues relating to pregnancy and childbirth. The primary audiences for the questionnaire were pregnant women/nursing mothers and medical practitioners, and the study area was Uhumwonde local government area of Edo state. The responses as analyzed revealed a number of findings in the study. Some of the findings reported include the need for pregnant women to exercise, and the importance of breastfeeding. The study, amidst other recommendations, stressed the need for women to be educated on contraceptive methods available for use as birth control measure after pregnancy.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION         <br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF STUDY     <br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM              <br/>1.3    HYPOTHESIS OF THE STUDY        <br/>1.4    AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY            <br/>1.5    SCOPE OF STUDY       <br/>1.6    LIMITATIONS OF STUDY      <br/>1.7    DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>CHAPTER TWO<br/>LITERATURE REVIEW          <br/>CHAPTER THREE<br/>METHODOLOGY  <br/>3.0    INTRODUCTION         <br/>3.1    RESEARCH DESIGN     <br/>3.2    POPULATION OF THE STUDY<br/>3.3    SAMPLE SIZE     <br/>3.4    SOURCES OF DATA COLLECTION  <br/>3.4.1 PRIMARY DATA          <br/>3.4.2 SECONDARY DATA      <br/>3.5    SAMPLING TECHNIQUE       <br/>3.6    RESEARCH INSTRUMENTS            <br/>3.7    MEASUREMENT OF VARIABLES             <br/>3.8    METHOD OF DATA ANALYSIS<br/>CHAPTER FOUR<br/>PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS  <br/>4.0    INTRODUCTION         <br/>4.1    DATA DESCRIPTION<br/>4.2    DISCUSSION OF RESULTS   <br/>4.3    INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS     <br/>4.4    TEST OF HYPOTHESIS         <br/>CHAPTER FIVE<br/>SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS<br/>5.1    SUMMARY OF FINDINGS      <br/>5.2    CONCLUSION     <br/>5.3    RECOMMENDATIONS           <br/>REFERENCES            <br/>APPENDIX<br/>SAMPLE OF RESEARCH QUESTIONNAIRE<br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.0    INTRODUCTION<br/>Some very basic facts of human life are:<br/>1.      People have no control over whether or not they become alive;<br/>2.     Once alive they strive to stay alive;<br/>3.     They have a strong and instinctive drive to reproduce;<br/>4.     They all eventually die.<br/>Why are these facts ethically important?<br/>Human beings, as organisms, are subject to these facts of life, but uniquely in the living world, we are also able to rationalise and to moralise. We can readily understand that the basic instinct for life is present in other people too, and appreciate that we have a moral duty to protect that instinct in them. This has been termed the presumption in favour of life.<br/>Reproduction is the single most distinguishing characteristic of life. It is the driving force of evolution, which itself is responsible for the diversity of plant and animal species on Earth.<br/>We humans are living organisms and these forces act on us just as any other species with which we share the Earth. We feel the urge to reproduce at a very powerful biological level at various times in our lives. It is not surprising therefore, that over the course of history all aspects of human reproduction have been the subjects of intense moral and ethical debate.<br/>1.1    BACKGROUND OF STUDY<br/>        The study of reproduction is a relatively new specialty, and developed in large part from a focus on body politics during second wave feminism in the 1970s.  It was also in the 70s, that the first IVF baby was born, making “infertility,” more of a chronic condition as opposed to barrenness or sterility. As new technological advances made it possible for increasing numbers of infertile couples to conceive biological children, more people came forward to seek assistance with reproduction (Angela, 2011)<br/>Reproduction in humans and others mammals is the process by which sperm and egg cells are produced, brought together, join and develop into a new individual. Reproduction is the key to the continued existence of our species. Mammals reproduce by uniting sperm and egg internally in the female body by a process called internal fertilization.<br/>Many mammals reproduce only during particular seasons of the year; not so with humans. Men produce sperm more or less continuously and women ovulate (produce an egg) about once a month. The male reproductive tract consists of the paired gonads (organs that produce sex cells), the testes, where sperm are produced, plus accessory structures that store the sperm, produce secretions to activate them and finally conduct them to the inside of the female reproductive tract.( Richard, 2000).<br/>Mousseau and Roff (1987) conducted a comprehensive review of the heritable variability of the morphological, behavioral, physiological, and life history phenotypes (i.e., measurable traits) that covary with survival and reproductive outcomes in wild, outbred animal populations. The analysis included 1120 heritability estimates-- the proportion of variability across individuals that appears to be due to genetic variability—across 75 invertebrate and vertebrate species. Although there was con-siderable variation ---across species, contexts, and phenotypes--- in the magnitude of the heritability estimate, their analysis indicated that “significant genetic vari- ance is maintained within most natural populations, even for traits closely affiliated with fitness” (Mousseau &amp; Roff, 1987). The median heritability estimates were .26 for life history traits (e.g., age of maturation), .27 for physiological traits (e.g., cardiovascular capacity), .32 for behavioral traits (e.g., mating displays), and .53 for morphological traits (e.g., body size), values that are similar to those found in human populations (Plomin et al, 2001).<br/>Kingsolver et al (2001) reviewed field studies of the relation between the types of traits analyzed by Mousseau and Roff (1987) and survival and re-productive outcomes in wild populations.<br/>As aptly described by Alexander, “lifetimes have evolved to maximize the like-lihood of genic survival through reproduction” (Alexander, 1987), and the focus of life history research is on the suite of phenotypic traits that defines the species’ maturational and reproductive pattern (Charnov, 1993; Roff, 1992). A suite of traits must be considered because of the trade-offs involved in the expression of one phenotype versus another (Williams, 1957). The trade-offs are commonly conceptualized in terms of a competitive allocation of resources (e.g., calories) to somatic effort or reproductive effort, (Alexander, 1987; Reznick, 1985, 1992; Williams, 1966). Somatic effort is traditionally defined as resources devoted to physical growth and to maintenance of physical systems during development and in adulthood (West, et al, 2001), although growth also involves the accumulation, as in increases in body size, of reproductive potential. Reproductive effort is expended during adulthood and is distributed among mating, parenting, and in some species nepotism, that is, investment in kin other than offspring (Emlen, 1995; Hamilton, 1964).<br/>According to David (2003), Reproductive activity takes on two general forms: in semelparity all reproductive potential is spent in one breeding episode, but in iteroparity reproductive potential is allocated across more than one breeding episode. Semelparity is a more risky strategy because reproduction during poor ecological conditions could result in extremely high offspring mortality rates, with no opportunity to reproduce under more favorable conditions. Semelparity is, however, favored when adult mortality is high and thus the probability of surviving to the next breeding season is low. Under these conditions, individuals that devote minimal resources to somatic effort in adulthood and maximal resources to reproductive effort will produce more off-spring than individuals that do not. In contrast, iteroparity is favored when juveniles and adults are likely to survive from one breeding season to the next (e.g., due to low predation risks) and juveniles are unlikely to reproduce successfully (Roff, 1992; Wittenberger, 1979). For these species, the current reproductive effort is bal-anced against the costs of this effort with respect to survival and future reproductive potential. As a result, during each breeding season iteroparous species invest more in maintenance and less in reproduction than semelparous species (Roff, 1992).<br/>Reproduction involves costs associated with mating (e.g., finding mates), pro-ducing gametes and offspring (e.g., eggs), and for many species parental care (Roff, 1992). Mechanisms underlying the cost/benefit trade-offs involved in reproducing may be genetic or social/environmental, or they may represent a genotype by environment interaction (Reznick, Nunney, &amp; Tessier, 2000). Social costs include those incurred during intrasexual competition over mates and are described later. Genetic trade-offs arise when the same gene or genes affect two or more life history traits (Williams, 1957). In many species, reproducing earlier in life is associated with a shorter life span (Reznick, 1992). The same genes that promote early re-production have the negative consequence of accelerating the onset of senescence and reducing the life span.<br/>Life span is also influenced by more proximal reproductive costs, such as pro-ducing eggs, competing for mates, and caring for offspring, which can compromise the physical health and oftentimes the survival prospects of parents (Clutton- Brock, 1991; Steams, 1992). The underlying physiological mechanisms governing these cost/benefit trade-offs are not fully understood, but include the energetic demands of reproduction (e.g., parental care) and associated hormonal changes (Sinervo &amp; Svensson, 1998). For example, the development of male secondary sexual char-acteristics needed to compete with other males (e.g., antlers) or to attract females (e.g., a bright plumage) requires an increase in testosterone levels which in turn can compromise the immune system and survival prospects of unhealthy males (Folstad &amp; Karter, 1992; Saino &amp; Møller, 1994; Saino, Møller, &amp; Bolzern, 1995). Similarly, in the female collard flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) large brood sizes are associated with a reduced production of antibodies for a common parasite; the result is increased infection rate and mortality rate (Nordling et al, 1998).<br/>All other things being equal, evolution should result in a life history pattern in which females produce many, fast maturing offspring, that have an increased probability of surviving to reproduce (Williams, 1966). The fact that many species do not show this life history pattern indicates that the associated trade-offs are costly. These trade-offs include smaller and less competitive offspring that in turn suffer high mortality rates (Steams, 1992). Across species of plant, insect, fish, reptile, and mammal, offspring that are larger at time of hatching or birth have increased survival rates due, in part, to decreased predation risk and decreased risk of starvation (Roff, 1992). The trade-off is that females of these species produce fewer offspring than do females of related species that produce many smaller offspring. Thus fast maturation and large numbers of offspring are associated with low-quality offspring (i.e., high mortality risks and low competitiveness). High---quality---larger and more competitive---offspring come at a cost of fewer offspring produced during a reproductive life span. Many factors will influence whether a species tends toward a low-quality/high-quantity or high-quality/low-quantity reproductive pattern, including age-specific mortality risks (e.g., through predation), population stability or expansion, and intensity of competition with conspecifics (Mac Arthur &amp; Wilson, 1967; Steams, 1992; Roff, 1992).<br/>Species that produce fewer and larger offspring also tend to have slower rates of growth, higher levels of parental care, and longer life spans in comparison to related species that produce smaller but more offspring (Roff, 1992; Shine, 1978, 1989; Steams, 1992). This life history pattern is more common in iteroparous than in semelparous species and is associated with relatively low juvenile mortality rates and a low probability of reproducing at an early age (Roff, 1992). Low juvenile mortality is related to larger size at hatching or birth as well as to parental protection and provisioning (Clutton-Brock, 1991; Shine, 1978). As described later, a low probability of reproducing at an early age can result from reproductive competition with more mature individuals in the population. In this situation, delayed maturation can improve reproductive prospects through, for in-stance, an increase in body size. Large body size enables females to give birth to larger and thus more competitive offspring, and for males it facilitates male- male competition in adulthood (Carranza, 1996; Steams, 1992). In some species, developmental activity during the maturational period enables improvements in survival- and reproduction-related behavioral/cognitive competencies. Slow maturation and growth thus allows for the accumulation of more reproductive potential, through physical development and developmental activity, than is possible with faster maturing species. A sex difference in potential rate of reproduction can create a sex difference in relative emphasis on mating or on parenting. Most generally, the sex with the higher potential rate of reproduction invests more in mating effort than in parental effort, whereas the sex with the lower rate of reproduction invests more in parental effort than in mating effort (Clutton-Brock &amp; Vincent, 1991). This pattern arises because members of the sex with the higher potential rate of reproduction can rejoin the mating pool more quickly than can members of the opposite sex. Under these conditions, individuals of the sex with the faster rate of reproduction will typically have a higher lifetime reproductive success if they rejoin the mating pool and compete for mates than if they parent (Parker &amp; Simmons, 1996).<br/>For species with internal gestation and obligatory postpartum female care (e.g., suckling in mammals), the rate at which females can produce offspring is considerably lower than the potential rate of reproduction of some specific males (Clutton-Brock, 1991). In addition, internal gestation and the need for postnatal care results in a strong bias in mammalian females toward parental investment and results in a sex difference in the benefits of seeking additional mates (Trivers, 1972). Males can benefit, reproductively, from seeking and obtaining additional mates, whereas females cannot. In other words, males that compete for additional mates typically have more offspring than do males that do not compete and instead invest in parenting. Thus, the sex difference in reproductive rate, combined with offspring that can be effectively raised by the female, creates the potential for a large female--male difference in the mix of mating and parenting, and this difference is realized in 95-97% of mammalian species (Clutton-Brock, 1989). In these species, females can effectively provide the majority of parental care and do so. Female care, in turn, frees males to invest in mating effort, which typically takes the form of male--male competition over access to mates or for control of the resources (e.g., territory) that females need to raise their offspring.<br/>1.2    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br/>        Fertility changes with age. Both male and females become fertile in their teens following puberty. For girls, the beginning of their reproductive years is marked by the onset of ovulation and menstruation. It is commonly understood that after menopause, women are no longer able to become pregnant. Generally, reproductive potential decreases as women get older, and fertility can be expected to end 5 to 10 years before menopause. In today’s society age-related infertility is becoming more common because, for a variety of reasons, many women wait until their 30s to begin their families. Even though women today are healthier and taking better care of themselves than ever before, improved health in their in later life does not offset the natural age-related infertility. It is important to understand that fertility declines as a woman’s ages due to the natural age-related decrease in the number of eggs that remain in the ovaries. This decline may take place much sooner that most women expect and thus hinder their chances of reproduction.<br/>1.3    HYPOTHESIS OF THE STUDY<br/>        The hypothesis of this study is stated in the null as;<br/>Not every pregnant woman knows what to do if her labour starts early.<br/>1.4    AIM AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY<br/>The aim of this study is to outline the concept of reproduction in man and the challenges faced overtime.

The finding revealed that most of the localities were not appropriately informed on the effect of mosquito on man.<br/>The effect of these findings was discussed suggestion and preventives or control measures were recommended.<br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>Chapter One<br/>Introduction<br/>1.1       Background of the study<br/>1.2       Statement of problems<br/>1.3       Purpose of study<br/>1.4       Significance of the study<br/>1.5       Hypothesis<br/>1.6       Scope of the study<br/>1.7       Limitations of the study<br/>1.8       Definition of terms<br/>Chapter Two<br/>Literature review<br/>2.1       Classification and general features of mosquitoes<br/>2.2       Aede mosquitoes<br/>2.3       Habits and habitant of mosquitoes<br/>2.4       Life cycle of mosquitoes and its effects<br/>2.5       Life cycle of malaria parasite<br/>2.6       Life cycle of plasmodium<br/>Chapter Three<br/>Methodology<br/>3.1       Research design<br/>3.2       Population<br/>3.3       Sampling procedure<br/>3.4       Research instrumentation and administration   <br/>3.5       Validity and reliability of instrument<br/>3.6       Method of data collection<br/>3.7       Method of data analysis<br/>Chapter Four<br/>Data analysis/interpretation and discussion<br/>Chapter Five<br/>Summary, Conclusion and Recommendations<br/>5.1       Summary<br/>5.2       Conclusion<br/>5.3       Recommendations<br/>References<br/>Appendix  <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>1.1       BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY <br/>Globally, mosquitoes without questioned the most important of the insects. At present time over 200 million people in over a hundred and subtropical countries of the world live under the threat of mosquito. According to world Health Organization (WHO) it is estimated that mosquito causes or contributes to the deaths of between one and three million people each year, mostly children under five years of age. Generally, in science, the study of insects (Etomology) cannot be competed without the broad heading.<br/>MOSQUITOES    <br/>          Mosquitos play a very important role in any scientific discipline. It is noticeable, however, that an initiative insight into the nature and life circle of any scientific organism only comes to those who have a sound basic of observation and scientific discipline behind them for one to be successful in study of mosquitoes and its effects on man a special attention has to be paid on the study if its habits and life circle. Since special consideration is given to the environment in which these species of organism dwells, its role and mode of breeding should also be considered as these affect the life span of man.<br/>          In view of the above differences and diversity, this work will be limited to the study of mosquitoes and its effects on man. Many of mankind’s idealist enemes are found among the 85,000 species of stagnant and mosquitoes in “older dipteral” south largest of the insects groups. Most members of the order have a single pair of wings, hence the name diptera, meaning two lunged, most of them, just like the mosquitoes also posses tubular mouths which can piece the human skin for nourishing blood. The loss of blood is small, but as the insect is sipping, virus and other pathogens may pass from the insects into the human host. Sickness such as malaria, yellow fever, elephantiasis is transmitted through this ways.<br/>          There are about fifty species of the family, culiacdac many them are called Gnats,. They are thin flies with long fragile legs and narrow wings. Only the female how ever pieces the skins of mammals and suck blood the male defer from the female in having long pulps and feather like analenae.  In Ovia North East local government in particular and Nigeria in general, there are currently three species of mosquitoes all of which are potential malaria, elephantiasis and yellow fever transmitters. The spotted gnat (Anopheles maculipennis) is an example of the type of mosquitoes the rest with its abdomen raised at an angle and it head in line with the rest of the body. It has spotted wings and one sub-species (athroparus) which breeds in blackish water in coastal district. The common gnat (anlex pipien) is a very abundant mosquitoes near stagnant water and a type which rest with its abdomen parallel with the surface oni which its is resting and it head lowered at an angle. Aedes albopictus is one of the largest and fiercest mosquitoes. It has spotted wings and white ringed legs and body. The females attack man and other mammals literate in building, something and rests in the same position and has a very similar life history to that of a common gnat.<br/>          The mosquitoes as a member of the “orde” diptera has no posterior pair of wings but the posterior pair is represented only a pair of small club shaped structures, the halters. These look useless, but this cannot fly without them. A fly with its halters cut off can still beat its wings at the normal frequency and through the normal angle, but it lose control in the air, it a straight course and aliable to fall on its back. These halteres have an important function in the control of flight.      <br/>1.2       STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/>Accurate figures has shown that the mortality (death rate) of human being increases rapidly and again, there is an indication that the breeding rate of certain insects like mosquitoes is increasing geometrically too. T he entomology of insects, mosquitoes to be precise shows that most of the death of human being are caused as a result of the diseases transmitted by these vectors to their hosts. An insight of such diseases transmitted by the vectors are malaria caused by the females anopheles mosquitoes, yellow fever, caused by creoles mosquitoes. The transmission of the diseases I normally through the blood stream which contaminate the pure blood, resulting in acute sickness that are characterized by many symptoms such as sever fever, headache, vomiting, tiredness, dizziness loss of appetite which may finally result to death.    <br/>1.3       OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY <br/>The purpose of the study is to know the effect of mosquitoes on man. It is believed that in Africa as a whole and in Nigeria in particular, the diseases transmitted by mosquitoes to their host-man contributes immensely to about two third (2/3) of the total death recorded annually. So, it is worthwhile to take proper study of these adverse effects and hence know the panacea to curb the problems by reducing the breeding rate of these vectors (INSECTS). Also, the study is to create awareness of the effects of mosquitoes on man.<br/>Therefore, this research will help us to study properly of our environment and know what causes the high breeding rate of these insects (particularly mosquitoes) and their control or preventives measures.     <br/>1.4       SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>The study will provide knowledge on the danger and effect of malaria on human being. It is serves as a reaching text to members of the public, who could want to gain more or have a deeper knowledge, on the effects of mosquitoes on man. It also will serve as awareness to the people of Ovia North East local government area and to encourage non government organizations (NGOs) to participate in campaigning to the people on the danger of mosquitoes to man and its preventive measures.<br/>1.5       RESEARCH QUESTIONS OF THE STUDY <br/>1.           Can illiteracy about mosquitoes increase the rate of growth of mosquitoes and its effect on individual in a community?<br/>2.           Are mosquitoes more than people living in urban areas?

The health care delivery system of Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government is being geared towards aligning with the national goal on “health for all”. One way of achieving this goal is through the education of primary school pupils on better health care. This is certainly one of the domains of physical and health education. Health education is designed for primary school level to educate the pupils about common diseases in our immediate environment and their prevention.<br/>            Also health education can also bridge the gap, reduce some of our environmental hazards for the welfare of every citizen. It is well known that children are exposed to various hazards of communicable diseases, it is necessary to guide the children from these diseases. Therefore, the teacher should be very much concerned with the health welfare and survival of his pupils. Communicable diseases in the past have been “endemic” and now it has become “sporadic” because of the awareness of this study. As the name implies communicable disease is derived from the combination of two words, communicable and disease. Communicable is an illness that can be in exchanged, share, transmit or imparted.<br/>            Disease is an unfavourable condition of an organism caused by micro-organisms as a result of illness, disorder of the body or mind. Communicable diseases are sometimes referred to as infectious diseases. They are the diseases which are communicated from one person to another or from animals to man through personal contacts like air, water, dust or the use of personal belonging or families. The communicable diseases that are common in pupils in primary schools include; chicken pox, measles, cholera, whooping cough, typhoid, tuberculosis, craw-craw, poliomyelitis (infant paralysis). The research is intended to carryout the overview of communicable diseases among primary school pupils. It is also intended to give useful advice and suggestions to teachers in primary school in particular on how to prevent the spread of these communicable diseases among the pupils in primary school in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEM<br/>            This research intends to carryout an overview of communicable diseases among primary school pupils in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area as a case study the researcher intend to do this under the following statement of problems.<br/>a)    Are communicable diseases common among primary pupils in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area?<br/>b)    Do the pupils in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area learn in a dirty environment that will lead to the spread of communicable diseases among them?<br/>c)    Are the pupils and the teachers aware of the prevalence of communicable diseases in the primary school in the local government area?<br/>d)    Does over population in primary schools lead to the spread of communicable diseases among students?<br/>PURPOSE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The purpose of writing this project is as follows;<br/>a)    To identify the communicable diseases that is prevalent in primary schools in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area of Edo State.<br/>b)    To find out the effects of communicable diseases on the pupils and the society at large.<br/>c)    To outline the various causes of the diseases.<br/>d)    To reduce and control the diseases among primary school pupils in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area of Edo State.<br/>e)    To examine the nature and scope of communicable diseases.<br/>SIGNIFICA NCE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The importance of this study cannot be overemphasized.<br/>a)    The study would also be of great help to the ministry of health and the government whose objectives of primary health care are preventive health and gradual eradication of these communicable diseases.<br/>b)    It will help the teachers and the pupils to be aware of the commonest communicable diseases in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government primary schools with the view of preventing their spread.<br/>c)    It helps the teachers to prevent a crowdy classroom in order to give room for ventilation.<br/>d)    It helps the teachers to care about the health of the students and to know how to treat the infected pupil.<br/>e)    It helps in continuous training of teachers on disease control.<br/>RESEARCH QUESTIONS<br/>1.    What are the prevalent communicable diseases in the local government area?<br/>2.    How can communicable diseases be controlled?<br/>3.    Do communicable diseases have any effect on primary school children?<br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY<br/>            The study is exclusively limited to the effects of common communicable diseases on the educational attainment of primary school pupils in Ikpoba OkhaLocal Government Area of Edo State. It is possible to cover all communicable diseases within a short time, consequent upon this, the study is limited to the following diseases; measles, ringworm, and cholera.<br/>DEFINITION OF TERMS<br/>            The following terms were used in this research work, many have different meaning to many people in different fields but for the purpose of this study. The meanings of these terms are as follows.<br/>Communicable diseases: They are the diseases which are passed from one person to another through water, air, dust etc.<br/>Non-communicable diseases: These are diseases that cannot be spread through personal contact, water, dust, air, etc.<br/>Immunity: This is the ability or power possessed by children to resist infection.<br/>Dehydration: This is loss of water and dissolved salt from the body.<br/>Immunization: This is a form of disease prevention involving the injection of a vaccine or an antiserum into the body of an organism in other to protect the organism from attack by a disease.<br/>Vaccination: This is a form of disease prevention involving the administration of antigenic vaccine to stimulate the immune system of an individual to develop adaptive immunity to a disease.<br/>Lumps: This is an infectious disease characterized by the swelling of the neck and the cheek due to the inflammation of the parotid glands at the junction of the neck and the lower jaws.<br/>  <br/>\n\nWAYS OF ERADICATING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AMONG PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPILS IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF \r\nEDO STATE\r\n<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " WAYS OF ERADICATING COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AMONG PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPILS IN OVIA NORTH EAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF \r\nEDO STATE\r\n", "id": 33}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>USES OF COCONUT PALM PRODUCTION: A CASE STUDY OF AGBAZILO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>Agbazilo Local Government Area which is made up of many villages and towns have their headquarters at Ubiaja. This area is rich in coconut palm (cocos nucifera) this project therefore, reveals some of the economic uses of coconut palm products and how they can be made locally or industrially. In the work, it could be seen how coconut could be used for preparing some useful products. These products include, coconut candy, coconut cake, coconut palm sugar, brooms, mats, nets, brushes, woven bags, upholstery works and some other products that are very useful to mankind and the society. All these products are so useful to individuals and its brings income to the society.   <br/>TABLE OF CONTENT<br/>CHAPTER ONE <br/>Introduction <br/>General origin <br/>Maintenance of coconut palm <br/>Uses of coconut palm products <br/>Purpose of study <br/>Limitations of the study <br/>Scope of the study <br/>Significance of the study <br/>Statement of the problem <br/>CHAPTER TWO      <br/>Literature Review<br/>A brief summary of chapter two <br/>CHAPTER THREE             <br/>Method/materials <br/>Coconut candy, Coconut cake <br/>Coir or fibre utilization in Agbazilo <br/>Natural retting <br/>Minor products of food value <br/>Coconut palm sugar <br/>Sap collection and processing of coconut palm sugar <br/>Broom preparation <br/>Coconut shell utilization <br/>CHAPTER FOUR    <br/>Result/observation <br/>Analysis of coconut candy <br/>Processing trials of coconuts palm sugar <br/>CHAPTER FIVE <br/>Conclusion <br/>Problems/limitations of study <br/>Recommendations <br/>REFERENCES        <br/>CHAPTER ONE<br/>INTRODUTION<br/>Coconut which have its botanical name as cocosnucifera is used by every country all over the world but this project work is all about the local and industrial ways of using coconut palm products in Bendel state especially Agbazilo local government area. The people of Agbazilo local government area have fertile land for agricultural practice, though they use crude implements mostly, their main occupation is farming and hunting. Due to recent development in skills, the people of agbazilo have improved on the uses of these products; some parts can now be modernized. The coir fibre of interior quality obtained by partial retting in husks and subsequent mechanical decortication are used for stuffing mathresses, crushions and upholstery  <br/>In fact, the year 1976 is regarded as a ‘golden ‘year in Agbazilo. The local government council opened a training institute for the blind at Ubiaja. The aim of this was to train the blind (who were formally idle) how to make good use of coconut fibres (modernizing). <br/>GENERAL ORIGIN    <br/>For centuries now, there have been controversy among botanist over the origin of coconut. Until this moment, it has not been settled, this due to its mass cultivation and methods of dispersal. <br/>Three different theories have propounded on the origin of coconut palm. The first theory suggested the northern end of ‘andes’ as the probable place of origin from where the dispersal might have been effected by the pre-historic explorers into the pacific. The same theory also rely on the fact that coconut came from America and this made them very popular among neighboring countries. <br/>The second theory is in Favour of assigning its original habitat to the coasts of Central America from where the nuts might have been carried over by the equatorial ocean currents to pacific islands. <br/>The third theory presumes its place of origin to be some where in South Asia or Malaysia or in the pacific from where the coconut might have accidentally reached coasts of America. <br/> The above theories has its own merits and demerits, it is now widely accepted that the coconut palm might have originated, from America but some where in the old world tropics. However, in the absence of clinching evidence, it has not yet been possible to pinpoint the original habitat of the palm in the world tropics. <br/>MAINTENANCE OF COCONUT PALM <br/>It is most necessary to care for coconut palm from the time of planting to the third or fourth year that the palm can be made to bear early and well. Despite that, the seedlings should be protected from stray cattle till they attention sufficient height. This is done by financing individual’s plants or the entire garden. During the first year of planting, care should be taken to see that water as often as possible. During summer, the seedlings should be shaded properly. Shading reduces qualities and the frequency of watering. Termites, Rhinoceros beetle and the leaf eating caterpillar are the common pests found to affect mostly the young palms. The seedling should be inspected frequently and prompt control measures taken if affected by any of the above pests. Prophylactic sprayings with suitable copper fungicides should also be given against short rot and but rot diseases. <br/>USES OF COCONUT PALM PRODUCTS  <br/>            According to Burcill in 1966, he described coconut palm as one of the natures greatest gift to man. Another great botanist, Mr. Corner in the same year says that coconut palm products displays the whole range of human dependence on palm products. Coconut provides food, drinks, oil, medicine, fibres; timbers thatch mats, fuel and domestic utensils. <br/>            In Agbazilo, the manufactured coconut oil called udeagbon. This is mostly done by the women. This oil can be used for cooking, ointment, illumination, lubrication, soap making and cakes. The coir is the most important product that can be obtained by decertification of the husk. It is an industrial hard fibre. Ligin is the main constituent responsible for the stiffness of the coir. The bristile fibre is used in the manufacture of brushes and brooms. For commercial purposes, the yarn is used to make ropes, mats matting, nets and bags. The ability of coir yarn and rope to withstand the prolonged action of sea water makes them specially suitable for use on boat and ships. <br/>            The young fruit and matured ones are used for sacrifice to their godless known by them as (olokun). No wonder Mr. Corner describes the uses of legion. It is not surprising that it is called the tree of life, heaven and mankind greatest provider in the tropics. Coconut palm is very much cared for by the Agbazilos. To them, non of the parts is useless. And they cultivate them in a wide range for the benefit of the whole country mostly our Bendel State. More analysis of coconut products mentioned above shall be seen in other chapters. <br/>PURPOSE OF STUDY <br/>            This project is to show the importance and the uses of coconut palm products and suggests the ways in which, the locally manufactured ones can be improved on. As a result, the government should set up industries for processing coconut products in Bendel State. I believed that this will help to improve the states economic revenue. <br/>LIMITATION OF THE STUDY <br/>            In writing this project work, some problems were encountered of which they are: <br/>Transport problems: Most of the information were collected from the Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR). Transportation is a big problem because, it is sometimes difficult to get a direct road from Oluku to Nifor. <br/>Collection of textbooks: Collecting textbooks for the literature review was also difficult because there is no textbook which is mainly on coconut palm in the College Library. Textbooks were also collected from the Nifor Library etc. <br/>Recommendation: From discussion with the director of Nifor and with some villages like Ebelle, Ewohimi etc I got some information’s for this research work. <br/>SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>            The government should create an opportunity for young people that is coming to this field by giving them good instrument and good tools in other for it to bring out the best in the production of palm products. I believe that, if this is done, it will help to improve the states economic revenue. <br/>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY  <br/>            During this research work, I noticed palm products are very important to the economy. Without this palm product, it will be very difficult to get palm oil for cooking and brooms of which this is useful in cleaning the environment. <br/>            There are many product that can be gotten from palm and without this palms this product cannot be seen or used.<br/>STATEMENT OF PROBLEMS <br/>            In writing this project work, some problems were encountered of which with this problem, the production of palm products cannot be carried out. These problems are: <br/>a.            Lack of inadequate facilities for working. <br/>b.            Lack of good information can lead to a very big problem on the plantation of coconut palm products. <br/>c.            Without good foundation, it will be so difficult to get good palms. <br/>d.            Without good research, it will be difficult to get good information about the plantation of coconut palms <br/>e.            It is good to have a knowledge on the plantation of palm products before going into this field because it can lead to the effect from time to time. <br/> <br/>\n\nUSES OF COCONUT PALM PRODUCTION: A CASE STUDY OF AGBAZILO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA<div class=\"web\">\n<center>\n<button class=\"btn btn-primary btn-md\" data-target=\"#myModal\" data-toggle=\"modal\" type=\"button\">Download the complete Project  Materials</button> <br/>\n</center>\n</div>\n</div>", "title": " USES OF COCONUT PALM PRODUCTION: A CASE STUDY OF AGBAZILO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA", "id": 34}, {"content": "<div class=\"abstract\">\n<b>TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE: A CASE STUDY OF EGOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA, EDO STATE<br/>ABSTRACT</b><br/>This project give a summary of the entire research study which was designed to find out the way and the way forward in the treatment and prevention of sexually transmitted disease in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State.

Very many have been eliminated, examples are syphilis and Tuberculosis. Overcrowding, environmental degradation, poverty often inflate these disease. <br/>Many of these diseases may have arisen in the context of modern social trends. Perhaps the most frightened is the HIV and herpes disease unknown before the last eight decades of the twentieth century. This currently incurable virus has already infected more than 80% of the ordinary young adults population in parts of the sub-Saharan African an is rapidly spreading especially in the poorer and more socially unstable part of the world. However, syphilis is potentially one of the most controllable disease (STD). HIV is not nearly as transmissible as some other STD’s e.g. hepatics or gonorrhea. It is the cofactors of other STDs that largely explain the infectivity and prevalence of HIV. <br/>According to the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (NIAID) 2005 the prevalence of STDs shows 333 millions cases per annum. Anti-microbial treatment of some STDs is becoming increasingly problematic some strains of gonorrhea and chancrous are now resistant to all anti-biotic generally available in poorer countries. Despite anti-viral agents (and their combination) that have been developed to treat it, the vast proportion of STDs worldwide are not treated at all. This is affected by the cost of treatment.   <br/>1.2         STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMS <br/>This study attempts a critical examination of the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted disease which causes problems like infertility, scarring of fallopian tubes, sterility, heart problems and disorders of the central nervous system, sexually transmitted diseases also causes pelvic inflammatory diseases, which can lead to ectopic pregnancy or the formation of abscesses, cervical cancer, blindness and even death.  <br/>1.3         PURPOSE OF THE STUDY <br/>The purpose of this study is to:<br/>1.            Consider factors or means of prevention and treatments of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State.<br/>2.            Pre-disposed youths to STDs.<br/>3.            To assist partners or individuals in these localities discuss their sexual and STD history before having sex and to consider getting tested. <br/>4.            To help individuals that are sexually active to understand the symptoms and how they are spread. <br/>5.            To help the general population to understand the symptoms and how to diagnose the diseases. <br/>1.4         SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY <br/>Sexually transmitted diseases is not what can be sign handled, it is hoped that when study is concluded suggestions will be offered to rewards the pr3eventive measures of these disease by viewing some of the factors that propagate sex. This study will also be useful to researchers, scientists in the discovery of the new ways of treating some deadly STDs.<br/>1.5         RESEARCH QUESTIONS <br/>For the purpose of this study research questions were formulated. <br/>1.            Does faithfulness to only one partner whose sexually transmitted disease states has been proved by blood test prevent sexually transmitted disease?<br/>2.            Does abstinence from sex if you are single prevent sexually transmitted disease? <br/>3.            Does the use of anti-biotic help in the treatment of sexually transmitted disease?<br/>4.            Does voluntary counselling and sex education of the youths aid in the prevention of sexually transmitted disease?    <br/>1.6         SCOPE OF THE STUDY <br/>It is not an easy task to go round the nook and cranny of Egor Local Government Area in searching for information due to the fact that biological concept are being modernized as a result of arising discoveries by researchers or scientists or biologist. <br/>For one to get recent information there is the need to go on line search via the Internet, which is economically expensive and time consuming. To this end researcher has therefore resolved to study how sexually transmitted disease can be prevented and treated in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State. For example the purpose of this research attention will be focused on youth, traders, civil servants, students of secondary and tertiary institutions.  <br/>1.7         DEFINITION OF TERMS <br/>STD (AKA) Venereal disease (VD) is an illness that has a significant probability of transmission between humans or animals by means of sexual contact including oral sex and anal sex. <br/>Gonorrhea: An STD that affect the mucolls membrane particularly in the urinary tract and genital area.
